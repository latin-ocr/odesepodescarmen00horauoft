PREFACE

IN preparing this edition of Horace's lyrscal poems, Ι
have had in mind the needs of freshmen and sophomores.
The introduction is intended to give the necessary infor-
mation as to the poet’s life and writings. The text is the
vulgate, although in some passages Ι have preferred the
better manuscript tradition. As young students require
no little help if they are to understand as well as translate
the Epodes and Odes, Ι have not limited my commentary
to the baldest aids, but have tried to give such assistance
in interpretation as may help students to some apprecia—
tion of Horace‘s art and charm. The best illustrations
naturally are furnished by the poet’s own works; but I
have endeavored to show his relations to his Greek models
by quoting from them as freely as my space and judgment
allowed. To all the more difficult Greek passages I have
appended translations, both for the benefit of those who
cannot call themselves docti sermones utriusque linguae,

and in the hope that these translations may secure the
originals more attention than students generally give to
them. I have further given a number of quotations from
the later Latin poets to indicate in some degree the ready
acceptance which Horace's skillful phrases found among
his successors. In writing my notes I have drawn freely
on the fund of illustrative material which is now common
property; like every other editor, Ι am indebted to Keller
