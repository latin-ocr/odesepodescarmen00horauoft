1. Early Life and Education. — Quintus Horatius Flaccus was
born Dee. 8, 65 B.c., at Venusia, a colony founded in the time of
the Samnite Wars, on the borders of Apulia, near Lucania. His
father had been a slave, but was free at the time of Horace’s
birth, so that the son was ingenuus. His mother is never men-
tioned, and it is probable that she died while the child was too
young to remember her. His father was by profession a coactor,
a collector of moneys for goods sold at public auctions, who by
his thrift acquired a property sufficient to provide his son with the
best education obtainable in his time. In later years Horace pajd
a most sincere tribute of gratitude to his father’s devotion and
sagacity. From him he learned a rude but practical code of
morals, and it is undoubtedly to his influence that we may at-
tribute the poet's marked characteristics of moderatiori, temper-
ance, and sels-contr013 to his father's training was also due
Horace’s habit of observing men and manners, which bore fruit
in the shrewd and searching comments on life which have en-
deared him to many generations os men.

Up to the age of nine or ten Horace enjoyed such education
as the local school in Venusia afforded. Then his father, whose
sole ambition was to provide his son with the best education that
could be had, unselfishly gave up his business at Venusia, and
took the boy to Rome. Here he gave him proper attendants,
provided him with suitable dress that he might not be ashamed
among his high-born and wealthy schoolfellows, and with rare

devotion attended the boy himself as paedagogus.
