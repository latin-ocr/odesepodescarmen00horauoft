EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION [ξι

temporary poets. There, too, he made many friendships which
lasted him through life.

In the autumn of 44 ΒΩ. Brutus came to Athens, where the
people received him with enthusiasm as a liberator. The young
Roman nobles and Horace as well were attracted to his cause.
Why the freedman's son was given the office of military tribune in
the conspirators’ army—a position sor which he had no training—
it is hard to say, and the appointrnent not unnaturally aroused
envy at the time. It is probable, however, that Horace had
already made some reputation among his fellow students as a
skillful versifier, and Brutus‘ love of literature induced him to
prefer the youth. Of Horace’s military service we know little 3
his writings· show a familiarity with some islands of the Aegean
and the famous cities of Asia, which was probably gained at this
time, and it is certain that he shared in the defeat at Philippi in
42 B.e. No doubt he gave as good an account os himself during
his two years of service as his fellows ; the ironical description of
his flight at Philippi (C. 2, 7, 9 f.) is imitated from Archilochus
and Alcaeus, and is not to be taken seriously.

The defeat of the conspirators’ cause brought a crisis to Horace’s

accepted the new order of things, at first despairing of the state 3
but later, after the battle of Aetium had freed Rome from external
dangers, he enthusiastically proclaimed the permanence of the
Empire and celebrated the beneficence of Augustus' rule. But
his entire life after his experience at Philippi was that of a man of
letters, who mixed much with men rather as an observer than as a
participant in their life. His later history falls into three periods
of about ten years each: first, from his return to Rome to 29 13.C.,
the period during which he published his two books of Satires and
the collection of Epodes,· second, 29-19 B.c., the period of
his maturity, in which his genius reached its height. During
