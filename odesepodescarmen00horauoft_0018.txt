ἓξ 1-2] INTRODUCTION

these ten years he published the first three books of Odes (23 13.c.)
and the first book of the Epistles (20 nc.) . Of his personal history
during the last decennium (19—813.c.) we know but little. He
was less productive than in the two previous penbds, publishing
only the Carmen Saeculare (17ss.c.)‚ the fourth book of Odes
(aster ¹3 Rc), and the two literary epistles, which, with the Ars
Pomm, form a second book of Epistles.

2. Return to Rome—The general amnesty granted by Octa-
vian after the battle of Philippi allowed Horace to return to Italy.
His father evidently died before his return, and he came back to
find that Venusia, where his estate was situated, had been in-
cluded in the districts assigned to the veterans of the victorious
army, so that he ·was thrown on his own resources. His means
sufficed to buy him a positiOn as clerk to the quaestors, by which
his support was secured. In his leisure he turned to writing
Latin verses.

Horace had now at the age os twenty—four acquired consider-
able experience in the good and ill fortunes of life, and had lived
through some important national crises. During his school days in
Rome he had seen the rupture between Caesar and Pompey, and
was old enough to understand something of the serious danger to
the state which it involved; Caesar’s supreme position was well
established before he went to Athens, and he had had a part in
the final struggle between the would-be ‘liberators' and the dic-
tator's successors. While he never after showed any desire to
have a share in polines, it is most probable that these experi-
ences os his early manhood caused him to think and feel earnestly
on matters of state, so that in later life, when he had heartily
accepted the new regime, he expressed himself on subjects

“ touching the well-being of the nation with a warmth which no

other theme except personal friendship called forth. He lived
to see the national dangers removed, the Empire firmly estab-
lished, and to enjoy the blessings of peace under the rule of
Augustus.
