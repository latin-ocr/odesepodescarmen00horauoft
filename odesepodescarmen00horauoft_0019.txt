THE SATIREs ΛΝΒ EPODEs 1 [gg 3-4

3. The Satires—As has been said above, Horace had prac-
ticed Greek verses in the courses of his studies. He now turned
to composition in his native language. When he began to write,
Varius Rufus was the epic poet of the day, having won that posi-
tion by his epic poem on the death of Julius Caesar, published
before 3913.C. 3 Asinius Pollio was distinguished in tragedy; and
Vergil was beginning to be known for his bucolic poenis. The
field of satire as practiced by Lucilius (ca. 180-10313.c.)‚ com-
ments in verse on the most miscellaneous topics‚ appealed to
Horace, and in the leisure which his official duties left him he
began to write in hexameters after the manner of his model. He
understood that politics could no longer be srankly treated, and,
with few exceptions‚ he avoided personal attack 3 but his nature
and training had made him a keen observer os the life about him.
This life he chose for bis subject, and handled its different phases
in the familiar tone of a man of the world ς he always speaks as
one of the company at whose weaknesses he laughs, never preach-
ing or setting himself up as superior to his fellow-mortals. Horace
was blessed with a keen sense of humor as well as clear insight, so
that these sketches have always been held in high esteem, not
only for their cleverness and wit, but also because no other works
in Latin literature give us such vivid pictures of the actual life in
which the author shared. While Horace made a great advance
on the metrical art of his model, he never called his satires poetry.
His own name was sermones, ‘familiar talks,’ and he declared
that they were only distinguished from prose by the rhythm.
They were written at various times during the decennium follow-
·ing his return, and many were undoubtedly known before they
were gathered together into books. The first book was published
before 33, the most probable date is 35 J 34 ; the second in
30 13.c.

4. The Epodes.—At the time when he began to write satire,
Horace also attempted to introduce into Latin a new form of verse,
the epodic couplet, consisting of two verses, the second of which
