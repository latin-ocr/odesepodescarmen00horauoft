V'6. The Odes.—The second period of Horace’s literary activity,
29—19 B.C.‚ was devoted chiefly to lyric composition. He had
long been a student of Greek poetry, and the rhodels he now fol·
lowed were chiefly Alcaeus and Sappho (600 B.c.), whose measures
he adopted as his own, and from whose works ⁴he drew many themes.
While these two poets had the greatest influence on him, still, as
the notes to the odes will show, we find evidence of the influence
of Homer, Pindar, Bacchylides, Anacreon, Stesichorus, and the
three tragedians. He drew also from the Alexandrians, but chiefly
from Callimachus and Theocritus. Yet he followed no model
slavishly, and even in his closest studies from the Greek, he made
the themes his own. The earliest ode to which a date can be
assigned with certainty is 1, 37, written in 30 B.C.‚ on hearing of
the death of Cleopatra. A few may have been written before this,
but not many. For seven years Horace gave himself almost ex-
clusively to lyric verse. His mastery of form and language was
now complete, and his developed taste set a high standard of per-
fection. vThe eighty-eight lyrics which belong to this period were
never equaled in variety and perfection among the Romans, and
alone would entitle their author to the immortality he has enjoyed.
Many of these odes,—Horace called thern simply carmina,—
especially those addressed to friends, were privately circulated
before they were collected into the present three books ; these
were published in 23 13.c., as is‘ clear from internal evidence.¹

¹ The young Marcellus died at the end of 23 ΒΕ.. but it is hardly probable
that Horace would have published the reference to him in 1, 12, 45 f. in its
present form after his death ; further, in 2, 10 (and possibly 3, 19), Horace
mentions Licinius Murena, theffirother-in-law of Maecenas, who was involved
in a conspiracy against Augustus in the latter half of 23 ΒΕ. The publication
must have been earlier than the discovery of this plot. The latest reference
is to the death of Quintilius Varus in 1, 24, which Hieronymus records in 23
13.c.; and it is probable that 1, 4, in which L. Sestius is addressed, was written
about July, 23 B.c., when Sestius entered on his office as consul suffectus.
