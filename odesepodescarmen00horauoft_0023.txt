THE oDEs [ς 7

7. Arrangement and character of the odes—In arranging his
lyrics for publication, Horace placed at the beginning eleven odes,
each in a different metre, illustrating all the measures employed by
him sn the three books with the exception of the unique rhythms
in 2, 18 3 3⁸51&l Within this group certain other principles of
arrangement can be detected. The first word is Maecenas, and
the opening poem virtually dedicates the three books to their
author’s friend and patron, to whom he had already inscribed his
Satires and Epodes. The second ode celebrates Octavian as the
divine f 0 m
t9 Vergss 5 the fourth is addressed to Sestius, consul in the year of
publication. The others are arranged to secure variety in subject
as well as measure, a principle that is observed generally through-
out the three books, so that grave themes are relieved by light,
and a succession of similar metres is for the most part avoided.
The second book opens with an ode to Asinius Pollio, celebrating
his literary powers and touching sadly on the Civil Wars of which
Pollio was about to undertake a history. In the first six odes of
the third book, Horace comes forward as the teacher of the new
generafion, and deals earnestly with the problems and dangers of
the state. This is the largest group of odes on related themes,
and the Alcaic metre is used in all 3 but, as if to avoid wearying his
reader‚ Horace did not insert another ode in the same measure
until the seventeenth. He had also some regard for chronological
sequence, but this was always subordinate to the principle of
variety. Each book, too, has certain characteristics. In the first
there are a larger number-of studies from the §reqknthaningthe ’

certain metrical peculiarities.
