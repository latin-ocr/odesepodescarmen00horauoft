§§ 7-9] INTRODUCTION

placed at the end of his book the dainty verses, Persicos odi, puer,
,apparatum which picture him at ease and free from care.

f TQdes of Athe second book show more reflection, a deeper
sense of the poet’s personal relationsh1p toffiis friends, a more
serious and a graver attitude toward life. His d1dactic odes ere

lay stress on wise conduct, and the chffl

rather than on the means of securing enjoyment. T twenty

odes, wiffi two excepti9ns, are composed in the Alcaic and
Sapphic measures.

In the third book, Horace appears as the poet of the new Rome
established by Augustus. He shows a conscious pride 111 his posi-
tion as the priest of the Muses, and his didactic odes have a graver
and severer tone 5 yet he relieves his serious themes here, as in the
other books, by lighter and charming verses nowhere excelled.
The unity of the entire collection he emphasized by the form of
his epilogue in which he repeats the lesser Asclepiadie measure
used in the opening ode of the first book, but not elsewhere in
the first three books. With proud assurance he claims that by his
verse he has defeated death itself and won immortal fame.

8. The First Book of Epistlen.—With the publication of his
odes, in 23 B.c., Horace seems to have felt that his great work was
done, and for some years he wrote no lyrics ; he did, however, re-
turn to his earlier habit of recording in verse his observations on
life and manners, sermones, which he now presented in the form of
epistles. In some the epistolary form is only a cloak, but others
are genuine letters, one a letter of introduction. Some offer a
practical philosophy of life, others give rules of conduct, still
others celebrate the delights of quiet country life, one is in praise
of wine. The opening letter is to Maecenas, and announces Hor-
ace’s intention to abandon poetry and devote himself to philoso-
phy. The collection‚ twenty epistles in all, was published after
the middle of 20 ΒΕ.
