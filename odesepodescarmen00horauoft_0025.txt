ODES AND EPISTLES [§§ 9-10

19 13.c. lest him the chief poet of his day, and even those who had
long scoffed at the freedman's son were at last ready to acknowl-
edge his preeminence. His position received official recognition
in 17 ΒΕ. from the Emperor, who commissioned him to write a
hymn sor the great Secular festival of that year. A little more
than two years later, at the personal request of Augustus, he cele-
brated the victories of the young Neros, Tiberius and Claudius,
over the Alpine tribes; in two other odes he sang the praises of
the Emperor's beneficent rule. With these he joined eleven other
lyrics, mostly reminiscent of his earlier themes ς two of them, how-

13 ΒΩ. It was not dedicated to Maecenas, as all his earlier publi-

serve Augustus with his art, he did not dedicate the book to him.
That his sriendship with his patron was unbroken is abundantly
proved by the eleventh ode in honor of Maecenas’ birthday.

verse ; he is too old for it; the distractions of the city prevent
composition, and careful work is no longer appreciated 3 he will
therefore devote himself to philosophy, and seek that golden mean
which alone can bring happiness.

We hear from Suetonius that Augustus chided Horace for having
failed to address any os his sermones to him. This reproach Hor-
ace could not neglect, and about 14 B.c. he wrote an epistle to the
Emperor, in which he discussed popular taste in literary matters,
and defended the modern school to which he belonged against
those who had a blind admiration only for the ancient and ruder
literature. These two epistles he united with a third addressed to

the Pisones, father and two sons, naturally putting the letter to
