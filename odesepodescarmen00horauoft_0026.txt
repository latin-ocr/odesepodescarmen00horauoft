§g 10-13] INTRODUCTION

Augustus in the first place, and published the three about 13 ΒΩ.
This third epistle is of uncertain date, but probably written about
19—17 13.c. It is a didactic treatise on the art of poetry‚ but deals
chiefly with dramatic poetry‚ and with the qualifications —— genius
and hard work— essentia} for the poet. The common name, Ars
poetica (or De Arte poetica Liber), in all probability was -not given
it by Horace, but became attached to it before Quintilian's day.
By Hadrian's time the epistle had become separated from the two
with which it was originally published, and formed the tenth book
in an edition of which the four books of Odes, with the Carmen
Saeculare, the Epodes, the two books of Satires, and two os Epis-
tles were the first nine. In the MSS. it regularly follows the Odes,·
H. Stephanus in the sixteenth century restored it to its original
position.

12. Last Years and Death. -Of the last years of Horace's life
we know nothing. Maecenas died in the spring of 8 13.c.; his
dying charge to the Emperor, Horati Flacci ut mei esto memor,
bears witness to the unbroken friendship between the two men.
Horace survived his patron but a few months, dying after a brief
sickness at the close of the same year. He was buried near the
tomb of Maecenas on the Esquiline.

13. Personal characteristics. — Horace has lest us at the close
of his first book of Epistles an interesting description of himself

at the age of forty-four ε -
