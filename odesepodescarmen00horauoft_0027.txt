PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS [ᾖ 13

corporis exigui, praecanam, solibus aptum,
irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.

“Short in stature, prematurely gray, fond of the sun, quick to
take offense, but readily appeased.'' This agrees with the account,
given in Suetonius' life, where we are told that the Emperor joked
the poet on his short, stout figure. In Horace’s later years his
health was poor. While fond of mixing with society, he had a
greater love for quiet country life, and against the protests of Mae-
cenas spent much time on his Sabine farm or at his beloved Tibur.
Praeneste, Baiae, and Tarentum were also favorite places of resi-
dence. He remained a bachelor, and was never deeply moved by
love. Of all his flames named in his verses, only Cinara was cer-
tainly a creature of flesh and blood. The rest existed in his fancy
only, or were borrowed from some Greek.¹· While he can sing very
prettily of love, his verses have none of Catullus’ fire; they were
for Horace pretty works of art, but did not spring from his own

, passion. Likewise when he calls his friends to a carouse, we may

be sure‘that temperance, not license, was the chief feature of
his comissatio.

The subjects of his verse, whether lyric or pedestris, as he calls
his muse in a passage in his Satires, were of the most varied sort ;
hardly a feature of the life about him was left untouched, and
more proverbial sayings bearing on the ways and weaknesses of
men have been drawn from Horace’s works than from those of any
other Latin writer. Certain aspects of nature appealed to him;
and in a number of odes he shows the deepest interest in the
welfare of the state. While he frequently shows a jovial spirit,
yet there is, especially in the Odes, a melancholy that constantly
reappears and overshadows his merrier moods. Many of his
lyries deal with death and the cheerless grave 3 and his philosophy
of enjoyment and moderation has more in it of resignation than
os eager anticipation. Horace does not show that pathetic melan-
