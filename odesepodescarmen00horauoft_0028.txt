§§ 13-14] INTRonuc'rioN

choly which characterizes Vergil’s poetry; his melancholy is per-
sonal, that of a sensitive individual, who has learned not to expect
too much of this life, and has no hope beyond. Yet Horace
avoids intruding his melancholy on his audience, as he shrinks
from preaching, even in his most earnest moods.

The highest enthusiasms and deepest feelings were not given to
¹Horace ,- but this very fact has in no slight degree made him a place
lin the affections of ordinary men, who feel that he is one of thern.

14. Fame—While Horace never gained among his contempo-
raries the honor enjoyed by Vergil, whose imperial epic appealed
to the pride, as well as the imagination‚ of the Romans, still he
lived to see himself pointed out by the passers on the street as
the lyric poet of Rome, a fact to which he refers in C. 4, 3, 22 f.‚
not without a touch of pride. Augustus’ requests (cf. ἓ 9), too,
show the position in which Horace stood. Many lesser poets
honored him as their master and model, but their verses have all
disappeared; also the spurious works which Suetonius says were
circulated under his name. His poems were early used in schools‚
certainly before Quintilian's day3 in Juvenal's time, busts of
Vergil and Horace adorned schoolrooms ; so that for nearly nine-
teen centuries the works of Horace have formed part of liberal
education in western Europe. Learned criticism and interpreta-
tion by grammarians began at least as early as Nero's reign. But
the best proof of Horace's influence in antiquity is to be seen in
the numerous reminiscences, conscious and unconscious, of his
verses that are found in almost every Roman writer after him. In
the commentary of this book only a few such reminiscences are
quoted, but enough to suggest how constantly his phrases reappear
in later writers. In fact no other Roman poet but Vergil influ-
enced posterity to any like degree. Even in the period of re-
adjustment, which we call the Middle Ages, the works of Horace
were still read in schools‚ especially the Satires and Epistles, and
verses of moral import were learned by heart; the Odes and
Epodes were less used, and the Carmen Saeculare not unnaturally
