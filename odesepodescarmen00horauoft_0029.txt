’ In the Renaissance and modern times Horace's popularity has
been great. Over seventy editions, partial or complete, were
printed ‘before 1500. There have been many would—be imitators
of Horace’s lyric verse in the last four centuries, but no better
proof of the perfectiori of his art can be found than in the marked
inferiority of all attempts, both ancient and modern, to repeat his
measures. It is not exaggeration to say that no one since Horace’s
day has written Latin Alcaics or Sapphics that deserve to be com-
pared with their models. Naturally Horace’s influence on modern
writers of lyric verse has been marked. To illustrate this here is not
possible, but there is hardly a lyricist who has not felt his spell.
Among contemporary English writers, Austin Dobson's methods
and verses remind us most of the Roman bard. Yet Horace’s
lasting popularity is attested, not so much by literature, as by the
regard in which men of varied pursuits hold him. His wisdom,
his moderation and good-humored satire, coined into perfect
form, have won him an unique place in the affections of mankind.

dition are so numerous that it is impossible to classify them satis-
sactorily. The most important are : —

formerly in the Abbaye de St. Pierre on Mt. Blandin, near Ghent‚
but was burned when the Abbey was destroyed by fire in 1566.
It was one of the four manuscripts borrowed from the monastery
