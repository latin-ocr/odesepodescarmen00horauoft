ξ 15] INTRODUCTION

in 1565, and collated for his edition of Horace by Cruquius
(Jacques de Crusque)‚ professor at Bruges. He states in his
edition of 1578 that this manuscript dated from the seventh
century, and the readings which he gives from it show that, what-
ever its age, it was of prime importance for the text. Keller an'd
Holder deny its very existence, and charge Cruquius with salse—
hood, but the evidence against them is such that we cannot doubt
the existence and value of the codex. Cruquius was at time-2
careless, but his account can in the main be accepted.

(2) Codex Bernensis 363, in the city library at Bern, Switzer-
land; written by an Irish scribe in the ninth century. The best
single extant manuscriptos Horace. Reproduced in photographic
facsimile under the direction of De Vries, 1897.

(3) Codex saeco-Vamanus 1703, in the Vatican Library, writ-
ten in the eighth century.

These two manuscripts are considered by Keller to be the most
important3 some claim high rank for others, especially Parisinus
7900 A, s. 1XsX; Parisim· 7974 and 7971, s. X; Parisinus 7972,
s. IX sX, and Leidensis 28, s. X 3 but in establishing the text the read-
ings of Cruquius’ ‘ Vetustissimus' are ordinarily of first importance.

For a description of the other manuscripts, reference may be
made to the critical edition by Keller and Holder, 2 vols„ Leip-
sic, 1864-1870; vol. 1 in 2d ed., 1899.

(b) Scholia.—Comment on the works of Horace began in
the first century of our era, with brief introductory notes, giving
in each case the name of the person addressed, the metre, and a
brief notice of the contents and character of the poem. Under
Nero, M. Valerius Probus prepared a critical edition of Horace’s
works. Among early Commentators were also⁴ Modestus and
Claranus, who flourished apparently in Domitian's reign 3 to the
time of Hadrian belong the Life, by Suetonius, which is preserved
in a fragmentary condition, and the edition in ten books (cf.

p. 22), by Q. Terentius Scaurus. Under the Antonines, Helenius ,
- Acro wrote an explanatory commentary.
