been brought into relation with associated ideas. It is therefore
necessary for the student to learn to carry in his mind incomplete
ideas through groups of words of varying length. Such groups are
common to both prose and poetry 3 but in prose they are usually
brief, combinations of three words being most frequent, e.g. ab
engm's profecta z'nitizk, although larger groups are not unknown.
But in poetry the arrangement and grouping of words is much
more highly developed. The following examples illustrate the
more common arrangements in Horace's lyrics, which the student
must train himself to grasp as units.

19. Groups of three words ε -—

1, 1, 1 atavis edite regibus

1, 15, 8 regnum Priami velus ,
1, 22, 22 terra domibus negata
2, 5, 12 purpureo varius colore
2, 7, 2 Bruto militiae duce

lt should be noticed that in these groups the first and third
words agree grammatically and inclose the word they modify3
and that the places of adjective and noun are varied at pleasure. In
the following larger groups the relation of the words is shown by
varying type so far as possible.

20. Groups of four words may have the following great variety
of arrangement ε -

2, 3, 9 pinus ingens albaque populus

2, 6, 5 Tibur Argeo positum colono

1, 24, 9 multis ille'bonis flebilis

1, 19, 11 f. versis animosum equis Ι Parthum

2, 8, 11 f. gelidaque divos Ι morte carentis

1, 1, 22 ad aquae lene caput sacrae

ι, 12, 22 f. saevis inimica virgo Ι beluis ⁶
3, 8, Ι 3 f. cyathos amici Ι sospitis centum

4, 1, 4 f. dulcium Ι mater saeva Cupidinum

(a) Often a verb or verbs form part of the group, e.g. :—

ι, 1, 34 Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton
1, 5, 9 te fruitur credulus aurea
