ξς 44-48] INTRODUCHON

sical time is ξ. While Horace adopted his measures from the
Greeks, he is more strict than his models in certain points. He
always uses an irrational spondee in place of a trochee before the
first cyclie dactyl (— >Ι-υ υ, and not — υ Ι ww) ; and if an
apparent choriambus -υ υ 4¹1- ¹ is followed by a second apparent
choriambus in the same verse, the caesura regularly separates the
two.
The following logaoedic verses are used by Horace:

45. The Adonic .·

terruit Ι urbem s
(This may also be read Lu υ Ι ί Ι Ξ Λ)

46. The A ristophanic .-

-Ιυυ Ι L υ l-s- >
Lydia Ι dic per Ι omnes l
(Thismayalso be read-lug, {Lu Ι ιᾸΙ ΞΑ)

47. The Pherecratic (read as a syncopated tetrapody catalectic) :

L > ι -fo ψ ι 1ἐι ΑΛ
grato Ι Pyrrha sub Ι αηΙίνο

48. The Glyconic .-

L->1 AoolL υιέΛ
sic te Ι diva pollens Cylpri

i.e. that both equal J 23 whereas the irrational spondee must be represented

in musical notation by ἃς.. Furthermore the musical equivalent of the

cyclie dactyl, as commonly expressed, -υ υ = aa ἒ, is hardly correct;

it should rather be 2.2·3·. In the schemes as here given the form -υ υ
is used when the caesura does not sall within the foot or falls between the two
short syllables, -υ ΙΙ υ; when the caesura occurs after the long syllable the
soot is written — ΙΙ W,

1 This combination was regarded by the later Roman writers as a choriam-
bus, — υ υ -, and many still give the name ‘ choriambic ' to metres in which
this succession of syllables occurs.
