54. The Greater Asclepiadic .-

L > ι Lo υιέ ιιέψ υιῑέιι-ωυιέψιόΛ
Nullam Ι Vare salcra ΙΙ vite priffius ΙΙ severis Ι arbolrem.

C. 1, 11, 183 4, 10.

It should be observed that this differs from the preceding rhythm
(53) in having a syncopated dipody ΙΙ —sv υ Ι 14 Ι inserted between
the two tripodies. In 1, 18, 16, caesura occurs after the prefix in
per! llucidior.
