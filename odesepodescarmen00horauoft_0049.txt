SYNTAX

The following paragraphs deal briefly with the constructions in
the lyrics of Horace, which depart most from prose usage.

TH E ACCUSATIVE

84. The perfect passive participle is used as a middle with a
direct object, sometimes accompanied by an instrumental abla—

, tive: 1, 1, 21 membra . . . stratus, ‘stretching his limbs.’ 1,

2, 31 nube candentis >umeros amictus, ‘ wrapping thy shining
shoulders in a cloud.' 3, 8, 5 doctus sermones, ‘learned in the
lore.’

85. The common prose use of the accusative neuter of ad-
jectives of number or amount is extended to other adjectives
which express the manner of the action ε 1, 22, 23 dulce ridentem,
dulce loquentem, ‘ sweetly smiling, sweetly prattling.'

86. The object accusative is used with many verbs which were
ordinarily intransitive before Horace's time : 2, 13, 26 ff. sonantem
. . . plectro dura navis, dura fugae mala, dura belli, ‘sounding
with his plectrum the hardships of the sea, the cruel hardships of
exile, the hardships of war.’ 4, 12, 5 Ityn flebiliter gemens, ‘sadly
mourning Itys.’ 4, 13, 19 spirabat amores, ‘ breathed forth love.'
Epod. 14, 11 flevit amorem, ‘ wept his love)

THE DATIVE

87. The dative of agent is used with the perfect participle:
1, 32, 5 barbite Lesbio modulate civi, ‘lyre tuned by Lesbian citi-
zen.’ Also with verbs expressing feeling or perception: 1, 1, 24 f.
bella matribus detestata, ⁴ wars which mothers hate) Rarely
with present passives: as 3, 25, 3f. quibus antris audiar? ‘by
what grottoes shall Ι be heard ?'

the direction of motion : 4, 4, 69 f. Carthagini iam nonego nuntios
