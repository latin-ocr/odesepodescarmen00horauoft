THE ABLATIVE

‘ The simple ablative, without a preposition, is used somewhat
2 more freely than in prose.
ἰ 95. The simple ablative is used to express the place where an
τ’ action occurs: 1, 2, 9 summa haesit ulmo, ‘clung in the top of
ἰ the elm.’ 1, 9, 10 f. ventos aequore fervido depraelianlis, ‘ winds
struggling over· the yeasty deep.’ 1, 32, 8 relegarat litore navim,
’, ‘anchored his ships off the shore,' also belongs here.
’ 96. Once in the Odes the ablative of agent is used without a
y preposition: 1, 6, 1 f. scriberis Vario . . . Maeonii carminis alite,
’ ‘thou shalt be sung by Varius, that bird of Maeonian song.'
With this we may compare Epist. 1, 19, 2 carmina, quae scribun-
,ίαν aquae potoribus, ‘verses written by teetotalers,’ although most
a editors and grammarians regard potoribus as dative of agent.
. While the phrase Vario . . . alite approaches the ablative abso-
’ Inte, the difference between it and such cases as S. 2, 1, 84 iudice
ζ, laudatus Caesare must not be overlooked.
⁷ 97. The instrumental ablative is found once with a verbal n'oun ε
ῑ 3, 4, 55 truncis iaculator, ‘ he who threw trunks of trees.'
J 98. With muto and a direct object the ablative is used to denote
· j both that which is given and that which is received in exchange ;
flihe context alone shows the relation: 1, 17, 1 f. Lucretilem mutat
ffiycaeo, ‘exchanges Lycaeus for Lucretilis.' The opposite 1, 16,
v2³25 f. ego mitibus mutare quaero tristia, ‘ I seek to substitute kind
feelings for bitterness.’

     
       
    
   
   

‘ TRANSFERRED ’ ADJECTIVES

99. An adjective which naturally expresses some quality of a
person οῖ’ thing is sometimes transferred to an object or action
Ἰ 'which is associated with that person or thing: 1, 3, 38 ff. neque Ι
.’ per nostrum patimur scelus Ι iracunda lovem ponere fulmina ,-
'3 1, 15, 33 f. iracunda . . . classis Achillei.
