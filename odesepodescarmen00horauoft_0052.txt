ἐξ roo-105] INTRODUCTION

THE ἀπὸ κοινοῦ CONSTRUCPION

100. Occasionally a word is so placed with reference to two ³

other words that it may grammatically be connected with either,
while logically it is necessarily so connected: 2, 11, 11 f. quid
aeternis minorem Ι consiliis animum fattjgas 2 In this consiliis
belongs equally to minorem and to salzgas.

THE VERB

101. A singular verb is frequently used with two or mbre sub-
jects: 3, 16, 29 ff. rivus aquae silvaque . . . segetis certa fides
. . . fallit.

102. The future indicative is occasionally used with permissive
or hortatory force: 1, 7, 1 laudabunt alii claram Rhodon,
‘others may praise,' etc. ; 1, 12, 57 ff. te minor lamm reget
aequus orbem, etc„ ‘let him rule,' etc.

103. The perfect is used like the Greek gnomic aorist, to ex-
press what has always been true or customary, i.e. a general truth
or customary action: 1, 28, 20 nullum saeva caput Proserpina
frigit, ‘cruel Proserpina never passes by (τῖε. never has, and there-
fore, by implication, never does pass) a mortal.'

PROHIBITION S

104. Horace occasionally employs the archaic form of prohi—
bition, consisting of the imperative with ne: 1, 28, 23 ne parce
harenae, ⁴ spare not the sand.’ ἢ

Occasionally a circumlocutionis employed : 1, 9, 13 fuge quae-
rere, ‘ avoid asking’ 3 1, 38, 3 mitte sectari, ‘ give up hunting.'

INFINITIVE

105. The ‘historical‘ infinitive is found but once in the Epodes,
not in the Odes: Epod. 5, 84 puer iam non . . . lenire verbis
impias, ⁴ the boy no longer tries to move the wretches by words.’
