’ s This ode forms the prologue to the three books of lyrics published
ἶ Horace in 23 13.c. After the first two lines addressed to Maecenas,

m‘ch virtually dedicate the whole collection to him, Horace rehearses

⁴ hers have lower aims—riches‚ ease, war, or hunting (9—28) ς but as
me, I have the loftiest aim of all, Maecenas —— to wear the ivy wreath
ε ,·-Isnv be the Muse’s dear companion (29-34).' The ode was clearly
