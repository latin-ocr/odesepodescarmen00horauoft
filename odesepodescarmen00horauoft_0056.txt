1, 1. 3] HORATI
,Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
collegisse iuvat metaque fervidis

5 evitata rotis, palmaque nobilis

terrarum dominos evehit ad deos;
hunc, si mobilium turba Quiritium

parable to the feeling expressed in
bpoa'. 1. Cf. the more formal
phrase 2, 17, 3f. Maecenas, mea·
rum Ι grande decus columenque
rerum5 also Epist. 1, 1, 103 rerum
tutela mearum. Vergil makes a
similar acknowledgment of his
obfigation, G. 2, 4of. ο decus,
0 famae merito pars maxuma
nostrae, Ι Maecenas. Horace's
phrase proved a striking one and
is frequently adopted by later
writers.

3ff. Note how Horace secures
variety in the expressions by which
he designates the various classes:
sunt quOS, hunc, illum, etc. He
has also arranged his typical ex-
amples with care, contrasting one
aim in life with the other, and in
each case bringing out the point
which would be criticised by one
not interested in that particular
purth.

— sunt quos . . . iuvat: equiva-
lent to aliquos iuvat. Cf. v. 19 est
qui. The indicative with this
phrase defines the class, rather
than gives its characteristics.—
curriculo: from curriculus, chariat.
—Olympicum: tle. at the great
games held every four years at
Olympia in Elis. Yet Horace
probably uses the adjective simply

52

to make his statement concrete.
Cf. note to v. 13. He is speaking
here of athletic contests in general.

4. collegisse: to have raised
in a cloud. Cf. S. 1, 4, 31 pul-
vis collectus turbine. -metaz the
turning post at the end of the
spina, which was the barrier that
ran through the middle of the cir-
cus, and round which the horses
raced. See Schreiber-Anderson's
Atlas, pl. 31, 1 and 2, for illustra-
tions of the race course.

5. evitata: just grand. The'
skill of the charioteer was shown in
making as close a turn as possible
about the meta without meeting
disaster. —— palmaque : equivalent
to quosque palma. The palm,
which was the regular prize for
the Olympio victor from the time
of Alexander, was adopted by the
Romans about 293 13.c. Li'vy 10,
47, 3 translato e Graecia more.
—nobilis: with active > meaning,
modifying palma, tke ennobling.

6. dominos: in apposition with
deos. The victory exalts the vic-
tors to heaven, where dwell the
rulers of the world. Cf. 4, 2, 17 f.
quos Elea domum reducit Ι palma
caelestis.

7ff. Political ambition. — hunc :
sc. iuvat. -mobiliumz fickle‚· cf.
