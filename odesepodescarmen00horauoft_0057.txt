CARMINA

[1, 1, 14

certat tergeminis tollere honoribus ;
illum, si proprio condidit horreo

quicquid de Libycis verritur areis.

Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo
agros Attalicis condicionibus
numquam demoveas, ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare;

Epis-t. 1, 19, 37 ventosa plebs.—
tergeminis: the three necessary
steps in the republican cursus
honorum, the curule aedileship,
praetorship‚ and consulship.

9f. proprio: with quicquid, re-

·. ferring to the avarice which is

’ frequently connected with great

wealth. For the expression, cf.

‘¹ 3, 16, 26 f. si quicquid arat im-

piger Apulus Ι occultare meis di-
cerer horreis. — Libycis: Africa,
especially the fertile district of
Byzacium about Utica and Ha-

Ῐ drumetum, was at this time the

granary of Rome3 later, Egypt

,¹ became the most important source
of supply.

nff. A modest establishment‚

, in contrast to a great estate in
ᾗ Africa—patrios: in this word there
is a suggestion of contentment and

enlm security, as in Epod. 2, 3 pa-

, tm rura. This security is again
’ contrasted with the vicissitudes
⁷ and perils of the sailor.—sarculo:

’ a hoe used for stirring and loosen-

ing the soil. It suggests the small

ι farm that Horace has in mind, too
“ small to make it worth while to

,- use a plum—Attalicis condicion-

η’,

t.

ibus: with tlte terms a prinae coulqy

offer.- regz'zlv opibus, says Porphy-
rio. The Attali, kings of Perga-
mon, were famous for their wealth.
In 133 B.C. King Attalus 111, at his
death, bequeathed his kingdom,
with his treasures, to the Romans.
This lent to his name the glamour
of wealth which we associate with
the name of Croesus.

13· demoveas: potential subj.‚
—you could never allure. — trabe:
bark. The part is used for the
whole. Cf. Verg. A. 3, 191 vela
damus vastumque cava trabe cur-
rimus aequom· Catull. 4, 3 natantis
impetum trabis. —— Cypria: Hor-
ace regularly employs a particular
rather than a general adjective,
thereby making his expressions
more concrete and his pictures
more vivid—a device learned from
the Alexandrine poets. So we have
in the following verse Myrtoum,
15 Icariis, 19 Massici, 28 Marsus;
and often.

14. pavidus: especially applica-
ble to the landsman turned sailor.
——secet mare: a common figure
from H omer's day. Cf. Od. 3.
173ff. αὖτὰρ ὅ ’γ’ ἡμῖν Ι δεῖξε, καὶ
ἠνώγει πέλαγος μέσον εἷς Εὔβοιαν ¹
τέμνειν.
