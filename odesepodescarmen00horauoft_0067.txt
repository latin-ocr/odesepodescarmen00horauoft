A propempticon, or farewell poem, to Vergil. ‘'Ship that bearest Ver-
gil to Greece, deliver him safe, I pray. (1—8.) That mortal was overbold
who first dared tempt the sea (9—24); of old man stole fire from Heaven
and by that act brought on himself disease and early death (25—33);
he essays the air itself and does not shrink to pass the very bars of
Acheron (34—36). rNothing is safe from him3 through pride and sin
he stin calls down the wrath of Jove.' Cf. with this the ill-natured
propempticon to Mevius, Epod. 10.

vVergil's only voyage to Greece, so far as we know, was in 19 B.C.,

four years after the first three books of the Odes were published.
Therefore we must believe that a visit to Athens was at least planned
by him before 23 B.C. or that Horace is here addressing another
Vergil than the poet. The second alternative can be rejected.
No other Vergil could have been called by Horace animae dimidium
meae without receiving mention elsewhere, save possibly 4, 12, 13.
For Horace's relation to Vergil, see Intr. 53 Sellar's Virgil, pp.
120-126.
· Itis remarkable that after the first eight verses which contain the
pgopempticon proper, Horace, who was usually so tactful, should quickl y
reverfto the old philosophical and theological notions of the sinfulness
of human enterprise without observing how out of place such ideas were
here, when Vergil was just about to show such enterprise by undertaking
this voyage.

It is probable that the form of the propempticon was suggested by a

Opoem of Callimachus, of which two verses are preserved. Frg. 114
ἅ ναῦς, ἃ τὸ μόνον φέγγος ἐμὶν τὸ γλυκὺ τᾶς ζοᾶς Ι ἅρπαξας, ποτί τυ
Ζανὸς ἷκνεῦμαι λιμενοσκόπω. . . . ‘ Ο ship that hast snatched from me
my life's one sweet light, in name of Zeus, guardian of harbors, 1
