HORATI

Statius* poem, Silvae 3, 2. is chiefly an expansion os

Horace's verses. In modern poetry we may compare Tennyson’s verses.
ln Alemor. 9. ‘Fair ship, that from the Italian shore Ι Sailoet the
placid ocean plains 1 With my lost Arthur‘s loved remains, Ι Spread «
thy full wings, and wast him o'er.' Metre, 71.

Sic te diva potens Cypri,
sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
ventorumque regat pater,
obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga,
5 ' navis, quae tibi creditum
debes Vergilium, fim‘bus Atticis

1. sic: expressing the condition
on which the prayer is made: ‘on
this condition may Heaven and the
wiuds favor thee, namely, that thou
deliverest Vergil safe.' Here sic
is expanded in the optative subj.
reddas and serves. Osten an im-
perative or a conditional sentence
follows. Eg. Epist. ι, 7, 69 f. ‘sic
tgnmtisse putato Ι me tibi, si cenas
hodie mecum? Similarly in Eng-
lish, e.g. Tennyson. ln Alcmor. 17,
‘So may whatever tempest mars Ι
M id-ocean‚ spare thee, sacred bark ς’
and the formula in oaths. ‘So help
me God.'

—diva potens Cypri: Κύπρου
μεδέουσα, Venus marina, the pro—
tectress of sailors. Cf. 3, 26, 5. 93
4 ιι, 15. For the objective geni-
tive with potens, cf. 1, 6, ιο lyrae
musa potens ,· 1, 5, 1 5 potenti maris
deo, i.e. Neptune.

2. Castor and Pollux. 1t was
believed that the presence of these
two guardians of sailors was at-
tested by the electrioel phenome-

non known to us as St. Elmo's fire.
Cf. 1, 12, 27 ff.; Lucian Navtjg. 9
ἔφασκεν ὃ ναύκληρός τινα λαμπρὸν
ἀστέρα Διοσκούρων τὸν ἕτερον ἔτι·
καθίσαι τῷ καρχησίῳ κεί-ἶ κατευθῦναι.
τὴν ναῦν; Stat. Silv. 3, 2, 8 ff. pro-
ferte bcmgna Ι sidera etantenmae
gemino considite cornu Ι Oebalii
fratres ‚· and in English, Macaulay,
Regillus, ‘ Safe comes the ship
to haven Ι Through billows and

through galae, Ι 1f once the great v

Twin Brethren Ι Sit shining on the
sails.' On coins a sm· is repre-
sented over the head os meh of
the heroes.

3 f ventorum.. ,patert Aeolus,
who is od. 10, 21 ταμίης ἀνέμων.

-Iapygaz the wind blowing from .

the west or northwest across
Iapygia, as Apulia was anciently
called, was favorable {br voyagae
to Greece.

Sff· Vergil is like a umure in- γ
trusted to the ship, and therefore
owed by it. Note the emphasis on
Vergilium before the mesura.—
