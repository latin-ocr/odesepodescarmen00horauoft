HORATI

Scriberis Vario fortis et hostiurn

victor Maeonii carminis alite,

quam rem cumque ferox navibus aut equis
miles te duce gesserit.

Pelidae stomachum cedere nescii

1. scriberis: expressing assur-
ance3 different from laudabunt
alii of the following ode, which is
equivalent to others may praise (if
they wish). The real subject of
the verb is ‘thy brave deeds
and victories‚' (lu) fortis et hos-
tium victor. — Vario: frequently
taken as abl. abs. with alite to
avoid the apparent solecism of
the abl. of agent without ab. This
is as unnecessary as to change
alite to the dat. aliti. For the
abl. of agent without ab, cf. Epist.
1, 19, 2 carmina . . ., quae scri-
buntur aquae potoribus. Intr. 96.

Lucius Varius Rufus was the in-
timate friend of Horace and Vergil.
With Plotius Tucca he was the
latter’s literary executor, and at
Augustus' command published the
Aeneid in 17 B.c. ; before the pub-
lication of the Aeneid he was reck-
oned the chief epic poet of the
period. S. ι, 10, 43 f. forte epos
acer Ι ut nemo Varius ducit. His
posthumous fame, however, seems
to have been based on his trage-
dies, especially his Thyestes.
Quint. 10, 1, 98, Varii Thyestes
cuilibet Graecarum comparari
potest. He brought out this play

not long after 31 B.c., according to
the didascalia, Thyesten tragoediam
magna cura absolutam post Actia-
cam victoriam Augusti ludis eius
in scena edidit. Pro qua fabula
sestertium deciens accepit.

2. Maeonii carminis alite: i.e.
the equal of Homer, who, according
to tradition, was born at Smyrna
in Lydia, anciently called Maeonia3
cf. 4, 9, 5 Maeonius Homerus. -
alite: for ‘bird' in the sense of
‘poet,' cf. 4, 2, 25 Dircaeum . . .
cycnum of Pindar‚ and 2, 20 entire.

3. quam rem cumque: this
tmesis is common in Horace (eg.
ι, 7, 25 quo nos cumque feret . . .
fortuna) and not unknown in
prose: Cic. pro Sest. 68 quod
iudicium cumque subierat.

5ff. With the following, cf.
the Anacreontic verses 23 θέλω
λέγειν Ἀτρείδας, Ι θέλω δὲ Κάδμον
ᾅδειν· ι ἁ βάρβιτος δὲ κορδατςι
ἔρωτα μοῦνον ἠχεῖ. -ιιοεε the
plural of modesty, so v. 17 below.
The singular of the first person
is ordinarily used in the lyric
poems, the plufal being found
only here and 2, 17, 323 3, 28, 9³
Epod. 1, 5. For the emphatic posi-
tion, see Intr. 22.—haec: ‘thy
