HORATI

curn fugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo

tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,
sic tristis adfatus amicos :

‘ Quo nos cumque feret melior fortuna parente,
ibimus, o socii comitesque!

Nil desperandum Teucro duce et auspice Teucro;
certus enim promisit Apollo

(17-20) byp, mythological illustra-
tion is a favorite device ofHotaceffi
This particular story is found only
here: Teucer's father, Telamon,
refused to receive him on his re-
turn from Troy, since he had failed
to bring his brother, Ajax, with
him; therefore Teucer sought a
new home in Cyprus, where he
founded a city, named after his
birthplace. The tale was a fa-
miliar one from Pacuvius’ tragedy,
Teucer, which was much admired.
Cf. Frg. 12 R. (which is a part of
Telamon's reproach) scgregare abs
te aasu's aut sine illo Salaminam
ingredi, 1 neque paternum aspac-
tum es veritus, quom ae'tate exacta
lndzgem Ι liberum lacera'stz'orbasti
effluxu, neque fratris necis 1 nique
eius gnati parvi, qui tibi in tutelam
est traditus? Cic. T asc. 5, 108 re-
fers to the story, itaque ad omnem
rationem Teucri vox accommodari
potest: ‘Patria est, ubicumque est
bene!

ing to exile. —tamenz ⁴ in spite of

The appropriateness of Teucer’s
honoring Hercules at this time
lies in the character of Hercules
as a traveler (3, 3, 9 vagus Her-
cules) and leader (Xen. Anah„
4, 8, 25 ἡγεμών), to whose pro-
tection Teucer might naturally in-
trust himself when starting on this
uncertain journey. Furthermore
it was in company with Hercules
that Telamon took Troy (cf.
Verg. A. 1, 619 ff.) and captured
Hesione, who became Teucer's
mother.
