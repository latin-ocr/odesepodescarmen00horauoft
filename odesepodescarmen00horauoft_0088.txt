HORATI

The ode clearly suggested to Tennyson the lines. ln Memor. 107,
‘ F iercely flies Ι The blast of North and East, and ice 1 Makes daggers ,

at the sharpen'd eaves‚ . . .

But fetch the wine, Ι Arrange the board

and brim the glass‚ Η Bring in great logs and let them lie, Ι To make
a solid core of heat31Be cheerful- minded, talk and treat Ι Of all

things evn as he were by.7

Γ haharchus (v. 8) is only a person of Horaces fancy, although
the name was in actual use, as is shown by inscriptions. The ode is
evidently a study and not an occasional poem3 while it probably be-
longs to Horace's earlier attempts at lyric verse, the skill with which it
is written has won admiration from all critics. Metre‚ 68.

1. The point of view is appar-
ently the neighborhood of Tivoli‚
from which Soracte can be seen
some twenty miles to the west of
north ς while Soracte is the highest
peak (2000 feet) visible from this
vicinity, it is not ordinarily the
mostconspicuous mountain. Snow
is seldom seen on it, and so Hor-
ace seems to choose this rare phe-
nomenon to suggest extreme cold
weather. — ut: interrogative. —
nive candidum: cf. Macaulay, Re-
gillus, ‘White as Mount Soracte Ι
When winter nights are long.'

3 f. laborantes : with the burden
of the snow3 cf. 2, 9, 7 f. where
the high wind is the cause of the
wood's distress‚ Aquilonibus 1 quer-
queta Gargani laborant. - flumina

constiterint: this degree of cold
is not known to the Campagna.
Horace here follows Alcaeus πε·
πάγασιν δ’ ὑδάτων ῥόαι. -acutm
bz'tz'ng‚sharp. Cf. Pind. P. 1, 38f.
νιφόεσσ’ Αἴτνα, πανέτης Ι χιόνος
ὀξείας τιθήνα, ‘ nurse of the biting
snow the whole year tbrough.'

5. dissolve frigus: ef. 1, 4, 1
solvitur acris hiems, and n. —
foco: the common hearth in the ἐν
middle of the atrium. ζ

6. reponens: ‘keeping up'the '
supply of wood3 re- implying a ³
duty to replace what the fire con· ’
sumes; cf. reddere. -benignius:
without stint, ἀφειδέως-ς the com-
parative is not opposed to the
positive large in any sense, but is
simply emphatic.
