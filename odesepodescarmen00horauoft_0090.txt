HORATI

15 adpone, nec dulcis amores
mg, sperne puer neque tu choreas,

donec virenti canities abest

mOI‘OSfl..

Nunc et campus et areae

lenesque sub noctem susurri
20 composita “repetantur hora;

nunc et latentis proditor intimo
gratus puellae risus ab angulo

and have no anxiety for what may
come on the morrow?'—fuge:
shun, cf. 2, 4, 22fuge suspicari.
— fors: personified, Dame For-
tune. - dierum: connect with quem
. . . cumque. For the tmesis, cf.
1, 6, 3. —lucro appone : in ori-
gin a commercial expression3
‘carrying to the profit account.'
Cf. Ovid, Trz'st. 1, 3, 68 in lucro
est quae datur hora milti.

16. puer: ‘while thou art
young.'—tu: in disjunctive sen-
tences the subject pronoun is
often reserved for the second
member as here, giving emphasis
to the charge. Cf. Epist. 1, 2,
63 lzunc frenis, lzunc tu compesce
catena5 and Iuv. 6, 172 parce
precor, Paean, et tu depone sagit-
tas.

17. virenti Canities: notice the
forceful juxtaposition3 cf. n. to 1,
5, 9.—virenti: sc.tibi. Cf. Epod.
13, 4 dum virent genua.

18 ff. morosa: crabbed. —nuncz
‘while thou art young,' repeating
donec vitenti, etc. The Campus

Martius and the public squares
(areae) were natural trysting
places. In our climate we have
little idea of the way in which
Italian life, from business to love-
making, is still carried on in the
squares (piazze) of the towns
and cities.—lenes . . . susurri:
cf. Prop. 1, 11, 13 blandos audire
susurros: ⁷ „

21 ff. nunc et: the anaphora
weakens the violence of the
zeugma by which this strophe is
connected with repetantur, be

claimed5 the opposite of reddere.

cf. n. on reponens, v. 6, above.
The skillful arrangement of the
verses is striking and cannot be
reproduced in an uninflected lan·
guage3 like an artist, Horace adds

to his picture stroke after stroke, ¹
until it is complete. Each idea in g
the first verse has its complement ν

in the second : —

latentis proditor intimo
pusillae rii-us ab arlagulo
Intr. 21.
