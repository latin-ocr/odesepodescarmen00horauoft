HORATI

‘Leuconoe, give up trying to learn the secrets of the future. Be ’
wise, do thy daily task, and live to-day3 time is swiftly flying.' This is
simply a variation of the theme (1, 9, 12 ff.), quid sit futurum cras,
fitge quaerere, et Ι quem fors dierum cumque dabit, lucro Ι appone. ⁷
Probably a study from the Greek, possibly of Alcaeus, as are 1, 18,
and 4, 10, the two other odes in the same measure. Metre, 54.

Tu ne quaesieris, seire nefas, quern mihi, quem tibi
finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios

temptaris numeros.

Vt melius quicquid erit pati,

seu pluris hiemes seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam
5 quae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare

1. tu: emphasizing the requests
to his imaginary Leuconoe, whose
name is chosen sor its pleasing
sound. By the collocation, quern
mihi, quem tibi, Horace represents
her as dear to him—ne quaesi-

' eris: archaic and colloquial for

the ordinary noli with the infini-
tive. —scire nefas: parenthetical.
Cf. Epod. 16, 14 nefas videre ; and
for the thought as well, Stat.
T heb. 3. 562 quid crastina volveret
aetas scire nefas homini.

2 f. nee: with temptaris, con-
tinuing the prohibition, for the
more common neve. — Babylonios

. . numeros: tlte calculations os
tlze, etc„ employed in casting
horoscopes. After the conquests
of Alexander, astrologers made
their way to Greece from the
east in large numbers and had
established themselves in Rome
as early as the second century
B.C., where they did a thriving
business among the superstitious.

They had become a nuisance as

early as 139 B.C. when the prae· g
tor peregrinus, Cornelius Scipio, j

banished them3 but they still con-
tinued to practice their art through-

out the republic and especially ¹

under the empire, in spite of many
attempts to rid Italy of them. Cf.
Tac. Hz'st. 1, 22 genus hominum
potentibus infidum sperantibus
fallax, quod in civitate nostra et
vetabitur semper et retinebitur.
-utz cf. Epod. 2, 10 ut gaudet

’ decerpens pira. —- hiemes: of years,

90

equivalent to annos ; cf. 1, 15, 35
post certas lziemes.

5 f. oppositis debilitat pumici-
bus mare Tyrrhenum: pumices is

used of any rocks eaten by the -,

waves3 cf. Lucret. 1, 326 vesco
sale saxa peresa. Sidon. Apoll.

assiduo lympharum verbere pu—
mex. The description given, how-
ever, is hardly appropriate to
the Tuscan Sea, in the region
