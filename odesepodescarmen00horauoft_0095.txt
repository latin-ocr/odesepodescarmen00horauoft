CARMINA

[1‚ 12

· Tyrrhenum. Sapias, vina liques, et spatio brevi

spem longam reseces.

Dum loquimur, fugerit invida

aetas; carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.

best known to Horace—sapias:
be sensibk, expanded in what fol-
lows. With the sentiment, cf. 1,
7, 17 sapiens finire memento tris-
titiam—vina liques: to free the
wine from sediment it was poured
from the amphora through a eloth
(saccus) or strainer (colum). --
spatio brevi: ‘for our life's span

⁹ is brief 3 ' opposed to spem longam.

Ῠ, Intr. 26. —resecesz cut short.
ζ 7. dum loquimur . . . fugerit:
⁴ note the force of the fut. perf.
Cf. Lucret. 3, 9¹4 f. brevis hic
ς estfructus leomnllis; 1 iam fuerit
, neque post umquam revocare licebit.
Y Also Iun. 9, 128 f. dum bibimus, . . .
obrepit non intellecta senectus.

8. diem: the flitting day,
equivalent to ‘primo quoque die

sruere,' according to Porphyrio‚
who adds that the figure is taken
from picking (carpere) fruit, ‘quae
carpimus ut fruamur.’ Cf. Lucil.
39, 51 M. hiemem unam quamque
carpam5 Mart. 7, 47, 11 ficgz'tz'va
gaudia carpe. The spirit of the
last line is also expressed in Epist.
1, 4, 12 f. inter spem curamque,
timores interret iras Ι omnem crede
diem libi diluxisse supremum ‚-
likewise by Persius, 5, 151-53,
who expands Horace's verse, in-
dulge gemb, carpamus dulcia, nos-
trum est Ι quod vivis, cinis et manes
et sabula fies, Ι vive memor leti,
fugit hora, [τοι quod loquor inde est.

—credula: of soolish confi-
dence, cf. 1, 5, 9 qui nunc te frui-
tur credulus aurea.

‘what hero, demigod, or god, dost thou prepare to sing, O Muse?
Whose name shall echo on Helicon, on Pindus, or on Haemus' height,
&where Orpheus charmed all nature with his strains? (1—12). Of gods

first surely father Jove ; then his daughter Pallas, then Liber, Diana, and
Phoebus (13—24). The demigod, Alceus' grandson, will 1 celebrate, and
¹ the twin brothers, who guard sailors from the angry sea (25—32). Then
the great Romans, Romulus, Tarquin, Cato, and the long line of heroes

aster them (31-44). Marcellus' same is growing3 the Julian star out-
ohines the rest (45—48). Father and guardian of men, in thy care is
Α mighty Caesar, greatest of all the Roman line. May his rule be second to

thine only ς may he conquer the Parthians and the remotest Eastern peo-
’ ples, and rule the wide wide world ς still shall he be thy subject, sor thou,
thou only shalt ever be Lord of Olympus, the Punisher of crime (49—60) .'
