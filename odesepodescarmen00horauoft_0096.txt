ι. ι2, 1] HORATI

This ode, like the second of this book, is in honor of Augustus, who

is celebrated as greatest of all the long line of Romanrheroes² the vicegffl„ ν

ςεῑεῃῑῳίροω;“ῗ’ἥ’ὲ mention of Marcellus (46) makes it probable
that the date of composition was either 25 13.C., when Marcellus was*
married to Augustus' daughter Julia and adopted as the Emperor's son,
or in any case between that date and Marcellus' death in 23 B.c. The
opening verses were suggested by Pindar's ode in honor of Theron
(O. 2) which begins ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι, Ι τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα
δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν; Horace proceeds, however, in very different fashion
from Pindar‚ who answers his question at once: ‘Of the GodS, Zeus;
of demigods‚ Heracles3 of men, Theron the victor.' Metre‚ 69.
