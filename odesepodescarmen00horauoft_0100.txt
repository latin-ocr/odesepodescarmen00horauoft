35 f. Catonis nobile letum: Hor-
ace passes in his examples of Ro-
man virtus from the last of the
kings to the last great republican.
Catos choice of suicide at Utica
(461;.c.) rather than of submission
to the new order of things, is fre-
quently referred to by his con-
temporaries and by writers of the
following century in terms of the
highest praise. Cf. Cic. ad sam.
9. 18 Pompeius, Scipio, Afranius
in bello civile foede perierunt. ⁶ at
Cato praeclare.' No question was
raised as to Cato's honesty of pur-
pose, and he became a kind of
canonized hero. Augustus' poliey
of allowing praise of all that was
noble in the champions of the re-
public made it possible for Horace
to do honor to Cato even in an ode
glorifying the emperor. Indeed
Augustus wisely forestalled his
opponents by praising Cato him—
self.

37 ff. Horace here returns to the
heroes of an earlier time—Regu-
lum: Regulus was a traditional

instance of that ancient Roman ᾗ

manhood (virtus) that preferred ⁴

his country's honor to his own life.
The fifth ode of the third book
holds up his sels-sacrifice as an
example for the youth of Horace's
own time. — Scauros: referring
chiefly to M. Scaurus and his son.
The father was called by Valerius
Max. 5, 8, 4 lumen et decus patriae,-
the son was involved in the defeat
on the Adige in 101 13.c. and shared
the panic-stricken flight under Ca-
tulus. His father sent him a mes-
sage saying that he should rather
have found his dead body than see

him alive after sharing in such a dis· -“

grace, whereupon the young man

killed himself. Valer. Max. l.c.; Ἴ

Aur. Vict. 3, 72 in conspectum suum
vetuit accedere: ille ob hoc dedecus

mortem sibi conscivit. —prodigum z .

cf. Ovid. Am. 3, 9, 64 sanguinis
atque animae prodtge Galle tuae. —
Paullum: L. Aemilius Paullus, who
chose to die at the battle of Can-

nae (216 nc.) rather than escape, =

as he might have done with honor,
according to Livy's account (22,

49)39. gratus: either of Horace's

own feeling of gratitude toward so ,
noble a character, or simply ‘ pleas- ³
ing,' ⁶ in verse pleasing my readers.' ’ί
