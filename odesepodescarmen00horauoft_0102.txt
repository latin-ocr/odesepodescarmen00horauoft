1. 12, 49] HORATI

Gentis humanae pater atque custos,
50 orte Saturno, tibi cura magni
Caesaris fatis data: tu secundo
Caesare regnes.

Ille seu Parthos Latio imminentis
egerit iusto domitos triumpho
55 sive subiectos Orientis orae
Seras et Indos,

te minor latum reget aequus orbem;

tu gravi curru quaties Olympum,
tu parum castis inimica mittes

60 fulmina lucis.

Epod. 15, 2 caelo fulgebat luna se-
reno inter minora sidera. Ι n both
he may have had in mind Sappho
Frg. 3, 1f. ἅστερες μὲν ἀμφὶ Κάλαν
σελάνναν Ι ἂψ ἀποκρύπτοισι φάεν-
νον εἶδος. ‘The stars about the
fair moon hide their bright face.'

49 ff. The climax of the ode.
With the idea expoessed, cf„ Ovid's
more extravagant laudatiori Met.
15, 8 58 ff. luppiter arces Ι temperat
aetherias et mundi regna trifor-
mt's,· Ι terra sub A agusto: pater est
et rector uterque.

51 f. secundo Caesare: logically
part of the prayer, and Caesar be
second to tlcee only.

53 f. The ‘Eastern Question'
was always an annoying one to
the Romans. Cf. n. to 1, 2, 22.—
egerit: tle. as captives before his
car. Cf. Epod. 7, 7fi—iusto . . .

triumpho: a technical term, im-
plying that all the conditions on
which a triumph depended had
been fulfilled.

55 f. The Serae (‘Silk-people,'
the Chinese) were known to the
Romans only through trade. They
and the Indians stand for the great
remote East.

57ff. te. . .tu. . .tu. . ,ε opposed
to ille v. 53. Intr. 28c.—-te
minor: cf. 3, 6, 5 Romane, quod
dis minorem te geris, imperas.—
reget aequus: rule in justice. For
the tense, see Intr. 102.

59 f. A stroke of lightning was
a most important omen to the Ro-
mans 3 if a sacred grove was struck,
that fact was proof that the grove
had been polluted‚ and required
purification. —parurm cf. n. to mi-
nus 1, 2, 27.
