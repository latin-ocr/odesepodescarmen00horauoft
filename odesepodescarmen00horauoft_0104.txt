13 f. non: emphatic, like the
English ‘No, you would not,' etc.
—dulcia barbare: cf. n. to 1,
5, 9. Intr. 26.

16. quinta parte: simply ‘the

We cannot be sure that Horace
uses the phrase as equivalent to

18 ff. inrupta:
rather than ‘ unbroken'; used like

invictus, etc., in the sense of an ⁷

adj. in -ilz's‚ -bilzzm — divolsus amor:
cf. 2, 4, 10 ademptus Hector. —
suprema die: life's last day.
