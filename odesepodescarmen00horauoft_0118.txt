Siccis omnia nam dura deus proposuit neque
mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines.

5 Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat?
Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
Ac ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,
Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
debellata, monet Sithoniis non levis Euhius,

Catili: Cati(l)lus with his brothers
Coras and Tiburnus from Arcadia

nult is chosen for the metre's sake.

8 f. The first of the examples
given to enforce the warning—
the quarrel between the Centaurs
and the Lapithae at the marriage
of Peirithoos and Hippodamia——
was a favorite subject of literary
and plastic art. Cf. eg. Od. 21,
294-304; Ovid. Met. 12, 210 ff.
The contest was represented on
the pediment of the temple of
Zeus at Olympia, and on the
metopes of the Parthenon.—

myth unknown to us or to the
familiar impetuous character of
