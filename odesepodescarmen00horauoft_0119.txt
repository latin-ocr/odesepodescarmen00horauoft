CARMINA

[1, 18, 14

ἰο cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum

discernunt avidi.

sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecynthio
cornu tympana, quae subsequitur caecus amor sui

name of Bacchus formed from
the bacchanal cry εὗοῖ. Cf. 2, 19,
5. Notice that Horace employs
here indiscriminately Latin and
Greek names of the god — Bacchus
6, Liber 7, Euhius 9, Bassareus 11
—his purpose being simply to
secure variety.

ιο. exiguo fine, etc.: with ap-
petite's narrow bound alone; i.e.
, when men in their greed (avidi)
make their passions the sole meas-
ure of right and wrong. In the
following verses Horace expresses
his thoughts, ‘I will not abuse thy
gift, fair Bacchus,' in the language
of the Dionysiae mysteries.

u. non ego: the common per-
mal note giving force and con-
citteness to the general statement.
For the order of words, see Intr.
21. 3o.—candide: used of brilliant
youuhful beauty, ‘fair and young'
(Wickham). Cf.. Ovid Fast. 3,
771 ff. - Bassareu: an epithet
formed from the Greek βασσάρα,
a foxskin. This was worn by the
bacchanals, who are themselves
mlled‘in the Orphic hymn 44, 2 A.

ια. quatiam: arouse, κινήσω,
ρῑύρεῆγ applied to the thyrsus
lad other symbols of the god,
aa by Catull. 64, 256 lzarum pars

tecta quatiebant cuspide thyrsos.
—variis obsita frondibus: the
sacred symbols (orgia) placed
in baskets (cistae) and covered
with ivy, grape, or fig leaves, etc.
Cf. Catull. 64, 254 ff. and Theoc.
26, 3 ff.

13. sub divum : into tlte lzjglzt of
day,· cf. ι, 1, 25 manet sub Iove
frzgido venator. — saeva tene,
ete: ‘And we pray thee, Bacchus,
do not excite our minds unduly
lest we fall into excess.'--saeva:
of the sound, ‘the wild din οἱ]
Cf. Verg. A. 9, 651 saeva sono-
ribus arma, and Catull. 64, 261 ff.
plangebant aliae proceris tym-
pana palmis Ι aut tereti tenues
tinnitus aere ciebant Ι multis rau-
cisonos ffabant cornua bombosl
barbaraque horribili stridebat tibia
cantra—Berecynthio cornu: cf. 3,
19, 18 f. cur Berecynthiae cessant
flamina tibiae. This is properly
the horn used in the orgiastic
cult of Cybele on Mt. Berecynthus
in Phrygia: by extension applied
to the horns employed in the wor-
ship of Bacchus.

14 f. quae subsequitur, etc. : i.e.
in the train of mad ecstasy inspired
by the god follow all too readily
sels-love (amor sui), boasting (glo-
ria) and faithlessness (arcani fides
