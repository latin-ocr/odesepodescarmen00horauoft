urit grata protervitas

[1, 19, 16

et voltus nimium lubricus adspici.
In me tota ruens Venus
ιο Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas
et versis animosum equis
Parthum dicere nec quae nihil attinent.
Hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic
verbenas, pueri, ponite turaque
¹5 bimi cum patera meri3
mactata veniet lenior hostia.
