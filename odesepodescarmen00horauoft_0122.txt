HORATI

‘ Cheap Sabine wine in modest cups shall be thy drink with me, my

dear Maecenas.

I sealed the jar myself some years ago.

Choice

wines thou hast at home3 but no F alernian nor F ormian grape flavors

my cups.'

These verses have the form of an answer to a letter from Maecenas

announcing his intention to visit Horace on his Sabine farm.

The

event mentioned in v. 3 ff. fixes the date of composition as after 30 B.C.
The ode shows a lack of finish, as if written in haste. Metre, 69.

Vile potabis modicis Sabinum
cantharis, Graeca quod ego ipse testa
conditum levi, datus in theatro

cum tibi plausus,

5 care Maecenas eques, ut paterni
fluminis ripae simul et iocosa

1. vile . . . Sabinum: just
vin ordinaire. The Sabine was
the lightest of the Italian wines,
according to Galen apud Athen.
1, 27 Β. who adds ἀπὸ ε’τῶν ἑπτὰ
ἐπιτήδειος πίνεσθαι μέχρι πεντεκαί-
δεκα. - modicis: with reference to
the material of which Horace's
drinking cups (canthari) are made;
plain earthen cups. not goblets of
silver or of gold.

2. Graeca . . . testa: an am-
phora in which a Greek—and a

κ, ,superior—wine had been imported.
The cheap Sabine would acquire a
better taste from being stored in
such a jar. Cf. Columella's in-
structions. 12, 28 si vasa recentia ex
quibus vinum exemptum sit habe-
bis, in ea (sc. vinum) confundite.

3. conditum: stored away, in
the amphora. For the process of

making wine, see Dictionary of
Antiquitas, s. v. vinum. —leviz
equivalent to oblevi. The cork
which stopped the amphora was

sealed with pitch or plaster. Cf. , -

3, 8, 9 f. hic dies . . . Ι corticem
adstrictum pice dimovebit Ι am-
phorae.— datus in theatro, etc.:
the only permanent theater at
this time was that built by Pom-
pey on the Campus Martius in 5 5
13.c. The occasion referred to
was in 30 13.c., when Maecenas
was greeted with great applause
on his first appearance aster a
severe illness. Cf. 2, 17, 25 f.
cum populus frequens Ι laetum
theatris ter crepuit sonum.

5 f. care: cf. 2, 20, 7 dilecte
Maecenas.-—eques: referring to
Maecenas' modesty in remaining
a member of the burgher class in
