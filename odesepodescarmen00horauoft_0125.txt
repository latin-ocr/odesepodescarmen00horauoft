Hic bellum lacrimosum, hic miseram famem
pestemque a populo et principe Caesare in

B.C. and Augustus' sickness. 24-2 3

> ‘The upright man is safe, no matter where he roams. 1 know
that this is true, friend Fuscus, for once in Sabine wood as I sang of
mage, a monster wolf fled from me, though I was unarmed. Put me
in chill northern gloorn or beneath the torrid sun, still will I ever sing
my'Lalage.'

The affected solemnity. of the first two strophes has often led com-
,mentators to interpret this ode too seriously‚ as if Horace were sol-
emnly preaching a moral Iesson. While an actual encounter with a
vols may have furnished the opportunity for the illustration‚ Horace
m the last man to use such an event to point a moral, still less take
÷ffimself for an example of the noblest virtue. He never preaches‚ and
ie always free from cant. As a matter of fact, the ode is a piece of
humor which Horace knew his friend Aristius Fuscus would appre-
date No doubt Horace had had many proofs of Fuscus fondness
for j0king3 he tells of one occasion (S. 1, 9, 61- —73) when his friend
refused to rescue him from a bore. The relations between the two
ἷίετο the closest. Cf. Epist. ι, ιο, 3 f. paene gemella fraternis animz's.
