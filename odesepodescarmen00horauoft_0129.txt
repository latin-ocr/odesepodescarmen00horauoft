A lament on the death of Quintilius Varus, the common friend os
Horace and of Vergil. He was an accomplished and, according to
Horace’s words, Epist. 2, 3, 438 ff.‚ an impartial critic, whose judgment
was valued by his literary friends, Quintil& siquid recitares, ‘corrige
sodes Ι hoc' alebat ‘el hoc! melius te posse negares, Ι bis terque exper—
tum frustra, delere iubebat Ι et male tornatos incudi reddere versus.
The year of his death is fixed by St. Jerome's entry against 24 Bc.
Quintilius Cremonensis Vergili et Horati familiares moritur. This
ode must have been written within the next few months. The Varus
of the eighteenth ode is probably identical with Quintilius. Metre, 72.

Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus

tam cari capitis? Praecipe lugubris

cantus, Melpomene, eui liquidam pater
vocem cum cithara dedit.

' ι. qnisdesiderio‚etc.: i.e. ‘who
m or would restrain his tears.'

caput5 Verg. A. 4, 354 puer As-
canius capitisque iniuria cari. So

lu prose we should have the geni-
tine depending on pudor, while the

’ &live is the natural case with

ως here the constructions are
united because modus contains the

, &detrahant idea3 so in Martial

8, 64, 15 sit tandem pudor et
andus rapinis.

in Greek, eg. ll. 8, 281 Τεῦκρε.
φίλη κεφαλή; and in English,
Shelley, Adonais, ‘Though our
tears 1 Thaw not the frost which
binds so dear a head* —- praecipe 2
teaclz me. —lugubris: indicating
the character of the strains.

3 f. Melpomene: properly the

a. meari capitis: for a soul muse of Tragedy3 cf. n. to 1, 12,

⁸? (ἰσων. For this use of caput, ef.
Q 5, 74 o multa fleturum

2. —liquidam . . . vocem: clear
toned ,⁸ cf. Od. 24, 62 Μοῦσα λίγεια.
