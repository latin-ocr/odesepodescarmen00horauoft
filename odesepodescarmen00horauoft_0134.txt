5 quid Tiridaten terreat, unice
securus. O quae fontibus integris

gaudes, apricos necte flores,
necte meo Lamiae coronam,

Pimplea dulcis. Nil sine te mei
10 prosunt honores. Hunc fidibus novis,
hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro
teque tuasque decet sorores.

formidatus, ille Ι missilibus melior
sagittis ,· Verg. G. 2, 497 coniurato
descendeus Dacus ab Histro. He
was finally crushed by P. Crassus

5. Tiridaten: not long before
the battle ofActium, Tiridates suc-
cessfully revolted against Phraates,
king of the Parthians, and suc-
ceeded him on the throne. In 30
B.C. Phraates returned to the con-
test and forced his rival to flee for
safety to Augustus, who was at that
timein Egypt. Cf. Mon. Anc. 5, 54ff.
aa’ me supp[li]ces confug [erunt]
reges Parthorum Tirida [tes et po-
stea] Phr-at [es] reges Phratzss fi-
lius]. The accounts of Justin and
Dio Cassius, our chief authorities for
these points, are conflicting, but
apparently Tiridates was again
placed on the throne in 29 13.c. —
cf. 3, 8, 19 f. Medus infestus sibi
luctuosis Ι dissidet armis —only to
be displaeed again in 27 B.C. by
Phraates, who had collected a large
force of friendly Scythians to aid
him. Tiridates then fled to Au-
gustus, who was in Spain. —unice
securus: persectly at ease.

κίλον ὕμνον.

plea ,· named from a fountain of the
Muses in Pieria near Mt. Olympus. -

mina possunt.—hunc . . . hunc:

his new verse (fidibus nobis) as
modelled on that of Alcaeus. Cf. 1,

strings of the lyre were struck.
