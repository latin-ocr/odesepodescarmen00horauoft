²5 particulam dare: sic, quodcumque minabitur Eurus
fluctibus Hesperiis, Venusinae
plectantur silvae te sospite, multaque merces
unde potest tibi defluat aequo
ab Iove Neptunoque sacri custode Tarenti.

30

Neglegis immeritis nocituram

postmodo te natis fraudem committere? Fors et
debita iura vicesque superbae

te maneant ipsum : precibus non linquar inultis,
teque piacula nulla resolvent.

35

Quamquam festinas, non est mora longa: licebit

iniecto ter pulvere curras.

25 f. sic: ‘ if you grant my prayer.'
See n. to 1, 3, 1. —fiuctibus Hespe-
riis: apparently the Adriatic. Since
Italy was called Hesperia, any waves
that beat on its shore may be called
by this name. -venusinae: the
woods near Horace's birthplace‚
about forty miles inland on the
ridge of the Apennines, and so ex-
posed to the winds.

27 f. plectantur, etc. : i.e. ‘may
the wind spend its fury on the
woods, and thou be safe from
harm.' The abl. abs., te sos-
pite, is the important part of the
prayer.—merces: reward. — unde z
referring to ab Iove. Cf. 1, 12,
17.

29 f. custode Tarenti: Taras, the
mythical founder of Tarentum, was
said to be the son of Neptune and

a local nymph. Some Tarentine
coins bear the figure of the sea god
seated on a dolphin. Next to
Jove, Neptune is naturally the god
who could confer most benefits on
the milon—neglegis committere:
wilt thou carelessly commit ,θ The
question is asked as the sailor
starts to turn away.

32. f. debita iura, etc.: tlzy just
obltgattbns5 i.e. the right of the
dead to burial, withheld by the
sailorin case he refuses the wraith's
request.-—vices superbae: stern
requital. —linquar: sc. a te.

36. ter: the sacred number in
offices due the dead. Cf. Verg.
A. 6, 229 and 506 magna llffam's

religious rites, cf. C. S. 23, Epist.

1, 1, 37.
