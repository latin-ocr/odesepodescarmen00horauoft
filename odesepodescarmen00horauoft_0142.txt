HORATI

⁶ What, Iccius, now envious of the Arabs' wealth and ready for their
conquest! Hast thou already chosen thy share of captured spoils?
Upon my word, all Nature may go topsy-turvy‚ when thou dost barter
all thy philosophie lore for a breastplate. I had thought better of thee.'

These bantering verses are addressed to Horace's friend Iccius, a
philosophie dilettante‚ who suddenly showed an interest in the prepara—
tions for a campaign against Arabia Felix, under the direction of Aelius
Gallus. The attempt terminated unsuceessfully in 24 B.C. The date
of composition therefore may be approximately fixed as 26 B.c. or early

1, 29]

25 13.c. Five or six years later, in 20 B.c.‚ Epist. 1, 12 was addressed
to the same friend, who then was manager of Agrippa's Sicilian e'states.
