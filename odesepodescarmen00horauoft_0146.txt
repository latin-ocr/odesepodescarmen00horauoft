HORATI

Premant Calena falce quibus dedit
10 Fortuna vitem, dives et aureis
mercator exsiccet 'culullis
vina Syra reparata merce,

dis carus ipsis, quippe ter et quater
anno revisens aequor Atlanticum
15 impune: me pascunt olivae,
me cichorea leves'que malvae.

Frui paratis et valido mihi,
Latoe,x dones et, pr‘ecor, integra

9-16. The contrast between
the luxury of the rich and Horace's
simplicity is emphasized. —pre-
mant: clzeck, prune‚· used by poets
for the prose putant5 eg. Verg.
G. 1, 157 ruris opaci falce premes
umbras.—Calena falce: cf. 1, 20,
9. — quibus dedit: sc. premere.

11. culullis: according to Por-
phyrio‚ these were properly earth-
enware cups used by the pontifices
and the Vestal Virgins in religious
rites. But the merchant grown
rich with trade uses cups of solid
gold.

12. Syra merce: spices, un-
guents‚ and costly persumes ·im-
ported from the Orient.

13 f. quippe . . . revisens:
surely for lte . . .‚ giving the rea-
son for the previous ironica] state-
ment dis carus ipsis. This par-
ticiple with quippe is equivalent to
the common ‘quzppe qui' explana—
tory clause.—aequor Atlanticum:
Gades (Cadiz)‚ buta short distance

outside the straits of Gibraltar, was
practically the lirnit of navigation
for the Romans ; t'neAtlantic was an
unknown and fearful ocean. With
the thought, cf. Aristot. apud lamb.
Protrep. 6 οὗ δὲ δεῖ χρημάτων μὲν
ἕνεκα πλεῖν ἐφ’ Ἡρακλέους στήλας
καὶ πολλάκις κινδυνεύειν, διὸ. δὲ

φρόνησιν μηδὲν πονεῖν μηδὲ δαπα- ’ '¹‘

νᾶν. ‘Nor for wealth need one
sail to the pillars of Heracles and
risk his life many times, but for
prudence’ sake he should not toil
or spend (overmuch).'

15f- me: the position of the
personal pronoun emphasizes the
contrast. Cf. n. to 1, ι, 29. Intr.
30. — leves: dzjgestible.
2, 57 f. gravi Ι malvae salubres
corpori.

17 f. paratis: equivalent to par-
tis, my possessions. —valido . . .
integra cum mente: cf. the familiar
words of Juvenal (ιο, 356) orandum
est ut sit mens sana in corpore
sano.
