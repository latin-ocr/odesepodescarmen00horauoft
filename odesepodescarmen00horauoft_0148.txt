otism that made him take a vigor-
ous part in the politics ofMytilene‚
especially against the tyrants Myr-
tilus and Pittacus. His sentiments
were expressed in political odes,

few fragments, 15—33 B. Cf. 4, 9,

off. With these verses cf. 2,
13, 26 ff. et te sonantem plenius
aureo, Ι Alcaee,plectr0d1cra navis,
dura fugae mala, dura belli.—
ferox bello: against the tyrants
named in last note, and also
against the Athenians in the Troad.
The following tamen shows that
the phrase is concessive—inter
arma, sive, etc. : ‘ in war or exile.'

7 f. religarat . . . litore: cf.
Verg. A. 7, 106 relzgqarat ab aggere
classem. Intr. 95. —- udo: sea-
beaten.

9 ff. ‘Wine and love were still
the subjects of Alcaeus' song, as
they must be of mine.'

11 f. Lycum: a favorite of Al-

caeus. Cf. Frg. 58 written ap-
parently in anger, οὖκέτ’ ἐγὼ
Λύκον ἐν Μοΐσαις ἀλέγω. —nigris
oculis, etc-2 points of beauty.
Note the shift of quantity nigris
. . . nigro. The description is
repeated Epist. 2, 3, 37 spectan-

dum mjg‘ris oculis mgroque capillo.

13 ff. A renewed invocation. — ’

dapibus supremi, etc. ε cf. ll. 1‚602 f.
οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐίσης Ι

nold's verses, quoted on 1, 10, 6.
15 f. cumque: temporaL modi-
fying vocanti and equivalent to
quandocumque te vocabo. No
parallel can be adduced to this use
of cumque as an independent
word, but we can safely accept
Porphyrio's explanation, who did
not find the phrase unintelligible.
— mihi salve: accept my greeting.
