[1. 33. 6

33

‘Albius‚ thou shouldst not grieve that Glycera prefers another, for
Venus finds delight in binding together strange mates3 I too have suf-

fered from her whims.'

The Albius addressed is probably Tibullus, the elegiae poet, a con-
temporary and friend of Horace. The fact that the name Glycera is
not found in Tibullus' poems does not make against the identification‚
which is as old as the first century A.D. There is no indication of the

date of composition. Metre, 72.

should not grieve . .
nimio: over muclz ,- connect with
doleas. Cf. 1, 18, 15 et tollens vac-
uum plus nimio gloria verticem.

2. immitis: unkind, unfaitlzful,
tothee. Note the contrast between
the epithet and the name, Glycera.
— decantes: drone and drona.
The compound with de· acquired
the meaning of continuously sing-
ing the same-note or strain. Here
itjs especially appropriate with
miserabilis, gloomy. —- elegos: re-
ferring simply to the form, a couplet
fiormed of a hexameter and a pen-
tameter; the Alexandrian poets
associated this form with sentiment
and love. For the development

of Roman elegy and its relation to
its model, see Sellar, pp. 201-223.

3f. cur, etc. : the complaint Al-
bius repeats in his verses, and at
the same time the reason for his
sorrow. For the construction, cf.
Epist. 1, 8,9f. irascar amicis Ι cur
me funesto properent arcere ve-
terno. —laesa fide: a second cause
for Albius' grief.

5ff. The following may have
been suggested by Moschus 6, rff.
ἤρατο Πὰν Ἀχῶς τᾶς γείτονος
ἤρατο δ’ Ἀχὼ Ι σκιρτητᾶ Σατύρω,
