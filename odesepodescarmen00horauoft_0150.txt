HORATI

declinat Pholoen; sed prius Apulis
iungentur capreae lupis

quam turpi Pholoe peccet adultero.
10 Sic visum Veneri, cui placet imparis
formas atque animos sub iuga aenea
saevo mittere curn ioco.

Ipsum me melior curn peteret Venus,
grata detinuit compede Myrtale
ι 5 libertina, fretis acrior Hadriae
curvantis Calabros sinus.

Lyde3 thus through Echo, Pan, Ι
Lyde, and Satyr, Love his circle
ran' (Myers).

— tenui fronte 3 a point of beauty,
as Lycus' black hair and eyes of the
preceding ode. Cf. Epist. 1, 7, 26
nzgros angusta fronte capillos ,· Pe-
tron. 126 frons minima et quae
apices capillorum retro fleverat. --—
Lycorida: the name is apparently
taken from the elegies of Gallus,
as Pholoe from those of Tibullus
(1‚8‚ 69)-

7. declinat: sc. a Lycoride.

9. turpi . . . adultero: low-born
lover. ——peccetz cf. 1, 27, 17 ingenuo
amore peccas.

1311. ipsum me: the usual per-
sonal experience. Intr. 30.—me-

lior Venus: in the same sense as 1, ⁷-

27, 20 meliore flamma. The con-
trast is furnished by libertina v. 15.

15 f. fretis acrior Hadriae: con-
cessive. The same figure is used

3, 9. 22 f. improbo Ι iracundior Ι
Hadria. The Adriatic was pro- ,

verbially rough. Cf. 1, 3, 153 2,
14, 14. —curvantisz when it hol-
lows out,· z'.e. in time of storm.
Cf. Ovid Met. 11, 229 est sinus

. Haemoniae curvos falcatus in

arcus. -— sinus: the accusative
expresses the result of the verb's
action.

‘Careless of Heaven, devoted to a mad philosophy, I was forced by
a bolt in the clear sky to change my course and to remind myself that
God can put down the mighty and exalt the low.'

The ode tells its own story and must not be taken too seriously, for
it may have been based on a Greek model. For Horace's religious views,

see Sellar, p. 159 ff. Metre‚ 68.
