HORATI

mutare et insignem attenuat deus,
obscura promens; hine apicem rapax
15 Fortuna cum stridore acuto
sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet.

κακῶν Ι ἄνδρας ὀρθοῦσιν μελαίνῃ
κειμένους ἐπὶ χθονί, Ι πολλάκις δ’
ἀνατρέπουσι καὶ μάλ’ εὖ βεβηκό-
τας Ι ὑπτίους κλίνουσ’. ⁶ lntrust
all things to the gods. Ofttimes
from missortune they set upright
men who lie prostrate on the
gloomy ground; osttimes too they
overthrow and cast down even
those who have prospered ex-
tremely? Also from the Magnifi-
cat, St. Lukc 1, 52 ‘He hath put

down the mighty from their seats,
and exalted them of low degree.'

14. apicem: properly the coni-
cal cap worn by the flamines, but
used here as 3, 21, 20 regum
apices, equivalent to tiara, the
symbol of royal power.

15 f. stridore acuto: ‘the shrill
whir' of F ortune²s wings. Cf. Verg.
Α . 1, 387 of the swans stridentibus
alth—sustulit: gnomic perfect,
lzas often bqfore now. Intr. 103.

‘O Goddess, Queen of Antium, who canst eant or humble. All .

court thy favor, the poor man and the prince, the wild Dacian and
Scythiam, the sturdy Latin stock, lest thou bring wild discord (1-16).
Fierce Destiny goes before with wedge and clamp (17—20)‚ but Hope
and Faith are thy companions (21—24); yet at sign of thy disfavor the
fickle crowd and false friend flee (25—28). Protect Caesar, we pray, in
his campaign against the Britons: guard our youth from dangers in the
East (29—32). May we expiate the crimes of civil strife with swords
new sorged against our eastern foes (3 3—40).'

The motive of this prayer is probably taken from Pindar, Ο. 12, 1-6
λίσσομαι, παῖ Ζηνὸς Ἐλευθερίου, ΙἹμέραν εὐρυσθενέ’ ἀμφιπόλει, Σώ-
τειρα Τύχα. Ι τὶν γὰρ ἐν πόντῳ κυβερνῶνται θοαὶ Ι νᾶες, ἐν χέρσῳ τε λαι-
ψηροὶ πόλεμοι Ι κάγοραὶ βουλαφόροι. αἴ γε μὲν ἀνδρῶν Ι πόλλ’ ἅνω,
τὰ δ’ αὖ κάτω, ψεύδη μεταμώνια τάμνοισαι, κυλίνδοντ’ ἐλπίδες. ‘ I beseech
thee, daughter of Zeus the Deliverer‚ Saving Fortune,-guard wide-ruling
Himera. For at thy beck the swift ships are piloted on the sea,
and on the land fierce wars and council-giving assemblies. The hopes
of men are tossed‚ often up, but again down, as they cut their
way through the high waves of falsity.'
