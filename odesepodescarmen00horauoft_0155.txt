CARMIN A

[¹³ 35, 30

Te Spes et albo rara Fides colit
velata panno, nec comitem abnegat,
utcumque mutata potentis
veste domos inimica linquis;

²⁵ at volgus infidum et meretrix retro
periura cedit, diffugiunt cadis
cum faece siccatis amici
ferre iugum pariter dolosi.

Serves iturum Caesarem in ultimos
30 orbis Britannos et iuvenum recens

ut hoc beneficium, quem admodum
dantur, trabali clavo figeret. —

manu . . . aena: cf. the English
‘iron hand.’—severus: unyield-
ing, harsh.

21 ff. The constancy of Hope
and Faith, even when F ortune
denies her favor, is set over
against the fickleness of the com-
mon crowd, the harlot, and false
friends—Spes . . . Fides: both
had temples at Rome3 tradition
said that it was King Numa who
&tablished the festival to Fides
(Livy 1, 21). —rara: since fidelity
is seldom found. —- albo velata
panno: ‚in offering sacrifices to
Fides the priest wrapped his right
hand in a white eloth. It is for
this reason, according to Servius,
that Vergil, A. ι, 292, calls Fides
cana. - nec comitem abnegat:
this is obscure, but the simplest
interpretation is to supply se:
‘even in adversity, F aith does not
,refinse to be man's companion.'

²3 f. There were not simply

Fortunae of places, cities, etc.‚
but also Fortunae of private
families. — mutata . . . veste:
‘changed from festal to mourning
garb.' — inimica ε predicative.

25. volgus infidum: proverbia13
cf. 1, 1, 7 mobilium turba Quiri-
tium.

26 f. With the idea expressed‚
cf. the Greek proverb ζεῖ χύτρα,
ζῇ φιλία. ‘Friendship lives only
so long as the pot boils.'

28. pariter: modifying ferre,
which itself depends on dolosi, too
false to share. The metaphor
ferre iugum is a common one. Cf.
Val. Max. 2, 1, 6 impariiugo cari-
tatis.

29 f. ultimos orbis Britannos:
cf. 4. 14, 47 remoti . . . Britanni.
Catull. 11, 11 ultimi Britanni.
Britain was practically a terra in-
cognita to the Roman until the
time of Claudius: the expeditions
of Julius Caesar had had no per-
manent result except to arouse
a desire for Britain's conquest.
