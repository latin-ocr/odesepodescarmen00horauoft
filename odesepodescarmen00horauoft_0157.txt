CARMINA

[1, 36, 11

The ocoesion for the ode may have been a dinner given by Lamia in
honor of his friend; the date is unknown. Metre, 71.

Et ture et fidibus iuvat
placare et vituli sanguine debito
custodes Numidae deos,
⁷ qui nunc Hesperia sospes ab ultima
5 caris multa sodalibus,
nulli plura tamen dividit oscula
quam dulci Lamiae, memor
actae non alio rege puertiae
mutataeque simul togae.
10 Cressa ne careat pulchra dies nota,
neu promptae modus amphorae

1 f. ture et fidibus: the regular
accompaniments of sacrifice. Cf.
4, 1, 21—24 illic plurima naribus Ι
duces tura, lyraeque et Berecyn-
tht'ae Ι delectabere tibiae Ι υιίχίιζτ
carminibus non sine fistula. -de-
bito: i-e. vowed to the gods if Nu-
mida should have a safe return. Cf.
2, 7, 17 ablegatam redde lovidapem.

4. Hesperia . . . ab ultima: from
the Romans' point of view Spain
was the ‘farthest west land'3 for
the Greeks, Italy.

6. plura: a larger share—di-
vidit: properly used of allotting to
each his portion.

8. rege: captain, leader in their
spons—puertiae: syncopated as
2, 2, 2 lamnae.

9. mutatae . . . togae: the toga
praetexta was usually given up for

⁴ the toga virilis at the age of sixteen

or seventeen years3 the occasion
was made a family festival. The

phrase, therefore, is equivalent to
our ‘ coming of age.'—cressa : terra
creta, chalk. White was the color
of joy, and happy days were given
a white mark. Cf. Catull. 107, 6
0 lucem candzdiare nota. Cf.
our ⁶ red-letter day! We are told
that another way of marking the
course of one's life was to drop
each day a pebble 1n an urn—
white for the happy, black for the
sad. References in literature are
not infrequent: eg. Catull. 68, 148
quem lapide illa diem candidiore
κρίθη Plin. Epist. 6, 11 o diem
laetum notandumque milei candi-
dissime calculo. Similar customs
are reported as existing among the
Thracians and Scythians.—ne
careat, etc.: best regarded as a
purpose clause dependent on the
following verses, 1 1—16.

11. neu . . . neu: the repetition
of the word six times marks the
