henflight as hawk pursues a dove (12-21). Yet she was no humble
woman; she did not shudder at the sword nor shrink at serpent's bite.
She scorned to grace a Roman triumph (21-32).'

The ode begins as a song of exultation on hearing the news of Cleo-
patra’s death, which reached Rome in September, 30 B.C. But in v. 21,
after applying the opprobrious fatale monstrum to the queen, Horace
suddenly changes to a feeling of admiration for the heroic courage with
which she saced death and cheated the Romans of half the glory of their
triumph. With this ode should be compared Epod. 9, written in celebra-
tion of the victory at Actium. It is noteworthy that in neither is An-
tony mentioned, the poet forbearing to glory over a fellow Roman. The
poem is probably modeled on Alcaeus' ode on the death of the tyrant
Myrsilus3 in any case the enthusiastic verses with which Horace opens
were suggested by the verses of Alcaeus preserved by Athen. 10, 430 A.

x. nunc: the triple repetition of
this word strengthens the contrast
with antehac nefas of the following
strophe.—1ibero: freed, as if the
dangers that threatened the state
had fettered the very feet of its
citizens.

3. ornare pulvinar deorum: in
celebrating a lectisternium in
thanksgiving to the gods, images
of the divinities were placed on
couches (pulvinaria), before which
rich banquets were offered for a
number of days ; with this was asso-
ciated a dinner for the priests.

been done already, ‘Why have we
