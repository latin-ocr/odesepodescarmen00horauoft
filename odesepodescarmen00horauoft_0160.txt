HORATI

5 Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum
cellis avitis, dum Capitolio
regina dementis ruinas
funus et imperio parabat

contaminato cum grege turpium
10 morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens
sperare fortunaque dulci

ebria.

ἦκουσιν; ὥρα δ’ ἦν πάλαι. Ovid
Am. 3, 1, 23 f. tempus erat tlzyrso
pulsum graviore moveri, Ι cessatum
satis est, incipe maius opus. This
interpretation is not inconsistent
with the following antehac nefas.

5. antehac: dissyllabic. Intr.
38. This synizesis‚ as well as the
neglect of the regular caesura in 5

and 14, probably marks this ode as'

one of Horace's earlier essays in
Alcaic measure.—caecubum: cf.
Epod. 9, 1 ff. quando repostum Cae—
cubum ad festas dapes. . . tecum. . .
Adaecenas . . . bibam.

6. dum Capitolio, etc.: there was
genuine fear at Rome that Augus-
tus would not be able to defend
Italy against Antony and Cleopa-
tra3 cf. Fast. Amz't. to Aug. 1‚C.I.L.
1, p. 398, feriae ex s(enatus) c(on-
salto), q(uod ) e(o) tl(ie) imp. Cae—
sar divi f(ilius) rem public(am)
tristissimo periculo liberat. It was
even said that Cleopatra had vowed
she would yet administer justice on
the Capitol, and that Antony had
promised her the Roman empire
as a marriage portion. The Capi-
tolium was the symbol of Rome's

Sed minuit furorem

lasting power. So Horace, in de-
claring his fame shall be eternal‚
says, 3, 30, 8ff. dum Capitolium
scandet . . . pontisas, . . . dicar . . .
deduxisse modos, etc.

7. regina: even more hateful
than rex ,- cf. Prop. 4, 1 1, 47 ff. quid
nunc Tarquinii fractas iuvat esse
secures l nomine quem simili vita
superba notat, Ι si mulier patienda
ficit ,· and the scornful emancipatus
feminae, Epod. 9, 12.—dementis
ruinas : again the transferred ad-
jective. Cf. 1, 3, 40 iracunda
fulmina. Intr. 99.

9f. contaminato grege, etc.: the
spadones rugosi of Epod. 9, 13 and
the roues of Cleopatra's court are
meant.-—turpium morbo, etc.: de-
filed, with lust. Catullus (57, 6)
reviles Marmurra and Caesar for
their dissolute lives with the words,
morbosi pariter. — virorum: in
this connection is ironical.

10. impotens: weak enough to
hope5 her passion had blinded her
judgment.

12. ebria: cf. Demos. Phil. 1‚49
οἶμαι ἐκεῖνον μεθύειν τῷ μεγέθει τῶν
πεπραγμένων.
