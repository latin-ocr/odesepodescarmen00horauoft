 

CARMINA

[1› 37, 24

vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
mentemque lymphatam Mareotico
15 redegit in veros timores
Caesar, ab Italia volantem

remis adurgens, accipiter velut
mollis columbas aut leporem citus
venator in campis nivalis
ιο Haemoniae, daret ut catenis

fatale monstrum.

Quae generosius

perire quaerens nec muliebriter
” expavit ensem nec latentis
classe cita reparavit oras:

13· vix una sospes: tlte fact
that hardly a single skip escapea'.
As a matter of fact Cleopatra es—
mped with sixty ships, while An-

tra's ships as well.

’ 1⁴1. Her drunken madness was
changed into genuine terror by Cae-

the autumn of 31 13.c. to Asia, win-
tered at Samos, and only reached

Egypt· m the summer of 30 Β. c. —
accipiter velut: a Homeric figure
Cf. ll. 22, 139f. ἠύτε κίρκος ὄρε-
σφιν ἐλαφρότατος πετεηνῶν, Ι ῥηι-
διως οἴμησε μετὰ τρήρωνα πέλειαν.

19 f. nivalis Haemoniae : i.e.The's-
saly in winter, the hunting season.
-- monstrum quae : construction ac·
cording to sense. Cf. Cic. ad sam.
1, 9, 15 illa furia muliebrium re-
ltgionum qui, etc.

21 f. At this point Horace sud-
denly changes to admiration for
Cleopatra's courage, that made her
prefer death to capture—genero-
sius perire z to die a nobler death. -—
nec muliebriter expavit: nor like
a woman did slze sear. Plutarch
(Ant. 79) says that on the approach
of Proculeius, Octavian's emissary,
Cleopatra Jried to stab herself.

23 f. nec latentis, etc.: there is
a tradition (Dio C. 51, 6; Plut.
Ant. 69) that Cleopatra thought of
