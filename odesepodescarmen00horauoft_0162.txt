HORATI

²5 ausa et iacentem visere regiam
voltu sereno, fortis et asperas,

escaping through the Red Sea. Yet
it may well be questioned whether
Horace knew of such plans on the
queen⁷s part3 he simply means to
say that she had no fear of death,
» and did not run away.—reparavit:
exchange5 i.e. in return sor the king-
dom she had lost. Cf. 1, 31, 12 vina
reparata merce.

25 f. Note the emphatic posi-
tion of ausa . . . fortis.—— iacentem:
ruined, razed to the ground. —trac-
tare: dependent on fortis, coura-
geous enough to. Intr. 108.

17 ater. . . Cocytos ; 3, 4, 17 atris vi-
peram—corpore: in her body; abl.
of instrument. — combiberet: the
compound is intensive, ‘drinking
deep.' So Cicero (defin. 3, 9) says
figuratively, quas (artes) si, dum
est tener, combiberit, ad maiora
veniet paratior.

29. T lte more courageous when
once resolved to die.

30 ff. The condensation of these

verses makes translation especially
difficult.—Liburnis: dat. with in-
videns. These were small swiftv

Liburnian pirates, and proved suc-
cessful against the unwieldy ships
of the enemy at Actium. Cf. Epod.
1, 1 and n. —scilicetz no doubt.—
invidens : cf. Shakespeare, Ant. and
Cleopatra, 5, 2 ‘Shall they hoist
me, Ι And show me to the shouting
varletry 1 Of censuring Rome ?’—-
privata: ‘no longer a queen‚' con-
trasted with superbo triumpho.—
deduci: the object of invidens.—

— no humble woman slze! Cf. Ten-
nyson's Dream of Fair Women‚ ‘1
died a Queen. The Roman soldier
found Ι Me lying dead, my crown
about my brows, Ι Α name for
everl' It is said that Cleopatra
frequently cried οὐ θριαμβεύσοραι.
