LIBER SECVNDVS

I

As the first three odes of the first book are given in order to Maece-
nas, Octavianus, and Vergil, so this book opens with odes addressed to
three friends, Pollio, Sallustius Crispus, and Dellius. The place of
honor is given to C. Asinius Pollio, who was one of the most distin-
guished men of his time3 born in 76 B-C. he belonged in his youth to
the literary circle of Catullus, Calvus, and Cinna. He had an honorable
political and military career, attaining the consulship in 40 B.c.; his
military services, in the course of which he served under Caesar and
after Caesar's murder under Antony, culminated in a successful cam-
paign against the Parthini, a tribe in Dalmatia, in 39 B.C. With the
booty gained he founded the first public library in Rome.

From this time he gave himself up to literary and forensic pumirs,
maintaining with honor a neutral position in the struggle between
Octavianus and Antony. Quintilian, Seneca, and Tacitus praise his
oratory (cf. 13 f.) in which he had hoped to rival Cicero3 his tragedies
(11-12) were celebrated in 39 B.C. by Vergil (E. 8, 10) as sola Sophocleo
tua carmina drjgna cothurno. Horace refers to them in the verse (S.
1, 10, 42 f.) Pollio regma Ι facta canit pede ter percusso. Following pos-
sibly the example of Sallust, he undertook to write a history of the civil
wars, with the first triumvirate, 60 B.c.‚ as his starting point. We do
not know to what date Pollio intended to bring his work--it undoubt-
edly included Pharsalus, Thapsus, and probably Philippi, —or whether
he completed his plan, whatever it may have been3 for while the work

- is referred to by Tacitus and Suetonius. it is to us entirely lost. Our

knowledge of his literary ability is based solely on his letters to Cicero
(ad. fam. 10, 31—33) which show a stiff and archaic style; an attempt
in recent years to ascribe to him the bellum Africum and a portion of
the bellum Alexandrinum has utterly failed. Pollio fi introduced
the practice os reading portinse of one's works to a etrele of friends
(recitationes), which became a regular habit under the cupite, and we
