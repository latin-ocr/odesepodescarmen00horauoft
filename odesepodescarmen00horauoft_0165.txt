HORATI CARMINA [2, ι, 6

may well believe that Horace had in this way heard portions of the
work he praises, apparently the parts dealing with Pharsalus, Thapsus,
and Cato's death (17-28).

The date of the ode is wholly uncertain, but it is noteworthy that
vv. 29-36 express the same weariness of civil strife and bloodshed that
we find C. 1, 2, and 14, Epod. 9 and 16. Metre, 68.
