2, 1, 7] HORATI

tractas et incedis per ignis
suppositos cineri doloso.

Paulum severae musa tragoediae

10 desit theatris; mox ubi publicas
res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes coturno,

insigne maestis praesidium reis
et consulenti, Pollio, curiae,
15 cui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.

frank historical treatment3 old
wounds would be torn open and
old animosities revived. The ex-
pression per ignis, etc.‚ is prover-
bial. Cf. Callim. Engg. 44, 2 πῦρ
ὑπὸ τῇ σποδίῃ, Propert. 1, 5, 4 f.
infelix, properas ultima nosse
mala Ι et miser {gnatos vestzgia
ferre per zjgnes. Macaulay, Hz'st.
Eng. c. 6. ‘When the historian
of this troubled reign <that of
James 11)‘ turns to Ireland‚ his
task becomes peculiarly difficult
and delicate. His steps—to bor-
row the fine image used on a similar
occasion by a Roman poet-are
on the thin crust of ashes beneath
which the lava is still glowing.'

9 ff. Note how skillfully Horace
introduces these complimentary
allusions to Pollio's other literary
attainments. — paulum: for a
little: z'.e. until the history shall
be finished. —- severae: solemn. —
desit: the public will miss the
tragedies. — theatris: with the
plural, cf. 1, 2, 15 f. This is not

proof that Pollio's plays were
acted3 they were probably in-
tended to be read.

11 f. ordinaris: set in order, tle.
have arranged the details of thy
work. — repetes: thou skalt re-
sume thy glorians task (grande
munus).—cecr0pio coturno : the
high buskin (cothurnus) was worn
by actors in tragedy, the low slipper
(soccus) in comedy. The adjective
cecropio is appropriate, as Athens
was the place where tragedy came
to its highest perfectiori.

13 f. praesidium . . . reis:
eight of the nine titles of Pollio's
speeches are for the defense. This
verse was probably in Ovid's mind
when he wrote of Germanicus
Fasti 1, 22 civica pro trepides cum
tulit arma reis. —consulenti: in
its deliberativas. The phrase in-
signe praesidium is still applicable
here, as Pollio's advice was a de-
fense to the welfare of the state.

16. Cf. introductory note to
this ode.
