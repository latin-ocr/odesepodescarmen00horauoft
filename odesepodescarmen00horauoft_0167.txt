CARMINA

[2, 1, 26

Iam nunc minaci murmure cornuum
perstringis auris, iam litui strepunt,
iam fulgor armorum fugacis
20 terret equos equitumque voltus.

Audire magnos iam videor duces
non indecoro pulvere sordidos
et cuncta terrarum subacta
praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

²5 Iuno et deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impotens

17. iam nunc: Horace dramati-
cally represents himself as actually
listening to the reading of the his-
tory.

18 f. perstringis: dinnast—
i'ulgor armorum: cf. the Homeric
χαλκοῦ στεροπή, and Quint. 10,
30 fulgorem qui terreat. qualis est
ferri, quo mens simul visusque
praestringitur. — fugacis: pro-

‘ horses into terrified ssight.' -

equos equitumque: cf. Tennyson's
similar assonance ‘while horse

opposing army is strained and un-

simply to give us a vivid picture
of the panic·strieken horsemen.

13, 369 atrox virtus. —Catonisz
the canonized object of praise by
stoics and rhetoricians. Cf. n. to
1, 12, 35.

25 ff. The mention of Cato re-
calls Thapsus and the long history
of wars in Africa. Juno was the
patron goddess of Carthage, in the
Aeneid the opponent of Aeneas,
and so hostile to Italy. With
this strophe Horace passes to ex-
pressions of regret for the civil
struggles that form the subject of
Pollio's history.

—cesseratz note the tense.
‘Once the gods had been forced
to withdraw from the doomed
African cities, powerless (impo-

have had their revenge.' The
Romans had a rite (evocatio) for
