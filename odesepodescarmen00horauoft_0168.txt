HORATI

tellure victorum nepotes
rettulit inferias Iugurthae.

Quis non Latino sanguine pinguior
30 campus sepulcris impia proelia
testatur auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinae?

Qui gurges aut quae flumina lugubris
ignara belli? Quod mare Dauniae
35 non decoloravere caedes?
Quae caret ora cruore nostro?

calling forth from a beleaguered

city of the enemy the local divini- ’

ties, whose departure was neces-
sary before the town could be
captured. When the gods had
gone„ the city was doomed. Cf.
Vergil A. 2. 351 f. (of Troy) ex-
cessere omnes, adytis arisque re-
lictis, Ι di, quibus imperium lzoc
steterat, and Tac. Hist. 5, 13, of
the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.

27. victorum nepotes, etc. ε the
commander of the Pompeian army
at Thapsus was Metellus Scipio,
grandson of the Metellus Numidi-
cus who commanded (109—107
Rc.) in the war against Jugurtha.
The Pompeians who fell at Thap-
sus, ten thousand in number, are
here described as offerings at the
tomb of the Numidian king. It is
interesting to remember in this
connection that Sallust had pub-
lished his jugurtha in recent years.

29. Latino sanguine: cf. Epod.
7, 3 f. parumne campis atque

Neptuno super Ι fusum est Latini
sanguim's?—pinguior : salter. Cf.
Verg. G. 1, 491 f. nec fuit indig-
num superis, bis sanguine nostro Ι
Emathiam et latos Haemi pin-
guescere campos.

30. impia: as pietas denotes
the proper relation between rela-
tives, the adJective unlzoty is espe-
cially applicable to the unnatural

Epod. 16, 9 impia . . . aetas.

31 f. auditumque Medis„ etc. :
the Parthians would naturally re-
joice at the internal quarrels of
Rome. Cf. Epod. 7, 9f. sed ut se-
cundum vota Parthorum sua l
urbs leaeo periret dextera—He—
speriae: i.e. the western world,
Italy.

33 f. gurges: stood, but often

equivalent of mare. Cf. Verg. G.
