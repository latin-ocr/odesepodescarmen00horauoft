CARMINA

Sed ne relictis, musa procax, iocis
Ceae retractes munera neniae;
mecum Dionaeo sub antro
40 quaere modos leviore plectro.

37 ff. Horace suddenly checks
himself ; as the poet of love he
must not allow his muse to raise a
strain of grief. In a similar fashion
he suddenly stops his serious verses
3, 3, 69 f. non hoc iocosae conveniet
lyras,- Ι quo, AIusa, tendis .?—ne
. . . retractes: dependent on quaere,
etc. You must not, . . . but rather,
etc. Cf. 1, 33, 1 ff. — procax: bold,
here hardly to be distinguished in
meaning from lascivus, applicable
to the muse of love poetry. —
iocis : παίγνια, songs of love and
wine, as eg. the fourth ode of this
book. Cf. 3, 3, 69 iocosa lyra.

38. Ceae retractes munera ne—
niae: assume again tlze sunctions
of the Cean dirge. Simonides of
Ceos (556—467 13.c.) was noted
for the pathos of his elegies (θρῆ-
νοι), such as he wrote on those
who fell at Thermopylae and Sal-
amls.

39 f. Dionaeo sub antro: Dione
was the mother of Venus. The
poet of love naturally seeks his
inspiration in her grotto. —leviore
plectro: cf. Ovid. Met. 10, ¹50 f.
where Orpheus says cecini plectro
graviore gigantas, Ι nunc opus est
leviore lyra.

⁶ Silver shines from use. Crispus, not when hidden in the earth.
Proculeius has won eternal fame by his generosity. He who curbs
his eager soul is more a ruler than the lord of Africa and Europe3 ava-
riee like dropsy grows by indulgence. True wisdom counts not happy
even Phraates seated on the throne of Cyrus, but reckons king only
him who has no lingering look for heaps of gold.'

The ode is addressed to C. Sallustius Crispus, the grandnephew and
adopted son of Sallust the historian, whose great wealth he inherited
in 36 Rc. At first he was a partisan of Antony, but later attached him—
self to Augustus and became his most trusted confidant next to Maece-
nas; like the latter he was content with equestrian rank, enjoying
in reality greater power and position than senatorial dignity could have
brought him. The moderation in expenditures here attributed to him is
hardly consistent with the statement of Tacitus, whose full account
(Annal. 3, 30) is as follows, atque ille, quamquam prompto ad capessen-
dos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatus, sine dzgnitate senatoria multos
