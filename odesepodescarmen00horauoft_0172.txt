vocibus, regnum et diadema tutum

deferens uni propriamque laurum,

quisquis ingentis oculo inretorto
spectat acervos.

21 ff. falsis . . . vocibus: ‘to
calla man beatus simply because
he is rich or powerful is a misuse
of the term. Wealth and power
are the sure possession of him
alone who is not moved by greed)
Cf. Sen. ley. 389 f. rex est, qui
cupiet m‘ltil,· 1 hoc regnum sibi
quisque dat. —regnum . . . defe-
rens: the method by which virtus
drives home her lesson.—dia-
derna : properly the blue band that

went around the Persian king's
tiara.

22. uni: to lzim and him alone,
who. — propriam: as leis sure pos-
session, repeating the idea ex—

23 f. ‘Whoever can look at
great heaps of treasure (and pass
on) without one backward glance.'
— inretorto: a compound made
by Horace with the negative prefix

In the preceding ode Horace expanded a Stoic maxim; in this he
gives us a similar treatment of a favorite Epicurean principle, ‘enjoy
life while you may, but never'too extravagantly, for death is close at
hand. Neither riches nor family can save us from the common doom.'

The Dellius addressed is undoubtedly Q. Dellius, whom Messala
nicknamed desultor bellorum civilium because of his frequent changes
of allegiance during the civil wars. In 31 B.C. he returned finally to]
Octavian's side, and later became one of his trusted courtiers. The ιι
place of the ode here was determined both by the similarity of its sub-
ject with that of 2, and especially by Horace's desire to give Dellius a
place next Sallust. Cf. intr. n. to 2, 1.

The date of composition cannot be determined, bnt is clearly later
than the reconciliation between Dellius and Octavianus. Metre. 68.

1 f. aequam . . . mentem,

defense against every change of

life? The sentiment is a common-

place. Cf. Archil. Frg. 66 μήτε
