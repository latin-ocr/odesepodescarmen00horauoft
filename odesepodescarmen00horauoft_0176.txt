HORATI

Who Horace's friend was is quite unknown. The name Xanthias

of Phocis is an invention, like ‘Cnidius Gyges' in v. 20 os the follow-
ing ode. The date of composition is fixed by v. 23 f. as about ἐς B-C.

Metre, 69.

Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori,
Xanthia Phoceu, prius insolentem
serva Briseis niveo colore

movit Achillem,

5 movit Aiacem Telamone natum
forma captivae dominum Tecmessae·,
arsit Atrides medio in triumpho

virgine rapta,

barbarae postquam cecidere turmae
10 Thessalo victore et ademptus Hector

1 ff. ne sit: a negative purpose
clause, depending on the following
illustrations. Cf. 1, 33, 1ff.; 4, 9,
1. We may translate, Yon need
not be ash'amed . . ., for Briseis,
etc. — ancillae: objective geni-
tive with amon—prius: used ad-
verbially, belonging to all three
examplesg ‘you are not the first.'
—- insolentem: for all lzis haughti-
ness. Cf. Horace's directions for
the portrayal of Achilles, Epist. 2,
3, 120 ff. scriptor si forte reponis
Achillem, 1 imnger, iracundus,
inexorabiles, acer Ι iura neget sibi
nata, niln'l non arroget armis. —
niveo colore: instrumenta} abl. with
movit. So Helen’s fair beauty was
described by the Alexandriam,
νιφόεσσα Ἑλένη.

4ff. movit . . . movit . . . arsit:
Intr. 28 c. —Telamone natum: the
Homeric Τελεμώνιος Αἴας. —-

forma: connect with Tecmessae.
—captivae dominum: the contrast
is emphasized by the juxtaposi-
tion. Intr. 26. —TEcmessaez for
the quantity, cf. Intr. 34. '

8. virgine rapta: Cassandra, who
was torn from the altar of Athena
by Ajax Oileus ; in the division of
the spoils after the capture of Troy
she fell to Agamemnon's share. ’

9—12. The strophe fixes the time
and gives the details of the triumph
in the midst of which the victor was
humbled by love for his captive.—
barbarae: i. e. Phrygiae, a term fre-
quently used by the Latin poets in
imitation of the Greek—cecidere
. . . Thessalo victore: i.e. when
Achilles returned to the battle after
Patroclus' death, and drove the
Trojans in ssight before him. -—-
ademptus Hector: the loss os Hec-
tor. Cf. 1, 3, ²9 and n.
