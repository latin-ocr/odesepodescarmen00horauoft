[2‚ 4, 24

tradidit fessis leviora tolli
Pergama Grais.

Nescias an te generum beati
Phyllidis flavae decorent parentes;
¹⁵ regium certe genus et penatis
maeret iniquos.

Crede non illam tibi de scelesta

plebe dilectam, neque sic fidelem,

sic lucro aversam potuisse nasci
20 matre pudenda.

Bracchia et voltum teretisque suras

integer laudo : fuge suspicari

cuius octavum trepidavit aetas
claudere lustrum.
