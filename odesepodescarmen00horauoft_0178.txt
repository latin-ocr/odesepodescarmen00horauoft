HORATI

‘Lalage is too young to bear the yoke of love. Wait a bit, and she
will follow you and outshine your former loves)

The comparison of the young Lalage to the heifer and the unripe
gmpe, as well as the bluntness of expression, did not offend the ancient

as it does the modern taste.

The ode lacks the unity of the better

lyrics, for the last strophe distracts our attention from the central object.
There is no hint of the date of composition. Metre, 68.

Nondum subacta ferre iugum valet
cervice, nondum munia comparis
aequare, ⁴nec tauri ruentis
in venerem tolerare pondus.

5 Circa virentis est animus tuae
campos iuvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
solantis aestum, nunc in udo
ludere cum vitulis salicto

praegestientis.

Tolle cupidinem

10 immitis uvae; iam tibi lividos

ι f. The figure is as old as Homer,
who uses παρθένος ἀδμής of a young
girl ς so δάμαλις and πόρτις in la-
ter writers—valet: the indefinite
subject is to be supplied from the
context, either puella, iuvenca, or
Lalage.-——munia: continuing the
figure of the first line‚—— ‘ to do her
part in dragging the plow.'

5. circa . . . est: is busy with,-
an extension os the local use, first
found in Horace3 evidently in imi-
tation of the Greek εἶναι περί τι.

61. nunc. . . nunc: now. . .again.
—fiuviis: instrumenta} abl. with
soLantis.

7f. udo . . . salicto: τῖε. which
grows on the banks of the stream.

9 f. praegestientis: a doubly em-
phatic compound‚ in place of the
simple gestio, expressing eager de-
sire. Lalage's only thought is to
gambol with her mates.-—-cupidi-
nem . . . uvae: the figure of the
heifer is abandoned for that of the
unripe grape, made familiar by
Alexandrian poetry. Cf. Anth. Pal.

5, 19, 3f. εἴη μήτ’ ὄμφαξ μήτ’ ἀστα-

, φίς· ἦ δὲ πέπειρος Ι ἐς Κύπριδος

θαλάμους ὡρία καλλοσύνη. ‘May ⁴
she be neither a green nor an over· ,
ripe grape3 but let her beauty be
