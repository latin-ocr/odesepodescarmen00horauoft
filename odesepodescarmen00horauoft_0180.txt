2, 6, 1] HORATI

6

Addressed to the poet's devoted friend Septimius, probably the same
whom he commends to Tiberius, Epist. 1, 93 he is also named in a
letter by Augustus to Horace, of which a fragment has been preserved
by Suetonius in his life of Horace (p. 297 R.). A melancholy strain
runs through the ode : the poet is filled with thoughts of his old age and
prays that Tivoli, or if that spot be refused, beautiful Tarentum, may be
the home of his last years. There Septimius shall shed a tear over the
ashes of his friend.

The exact date of composition cannot be determined‚ but it has been
conjectured with good reason that the ode was written during an illness,
or when Horace was oppressed with fears of early death3 it was cer-
tainly at a time when he felt his position established so that he could
speak of himself as ‘vates,' τῖε. it was after the publication of the epodes.
Possibly the reference in v. 2 may fix the date as between 27 and ²5
B.c. See n. below. Metre, 69.
