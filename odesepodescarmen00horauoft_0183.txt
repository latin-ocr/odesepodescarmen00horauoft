[2‚ 7, 8

CARM ΙΝ As

A welcome home to Pompeius, Horace's old companion in arms.

‘ Who has restored thee to thy horne, Pompeius mine, with whom l
once endured the dangers of the field and shared the joys of revelry
(1-8)? The hurry of Philippi's rout we knew together. Yes, I ran
away and saved myself- thanks be to Mercury. But thee war's tide
swept off upon the sea of further trouble (9—16). Come then, make
sacrifice and drain full cups of wine saved up against thy coming.
Away with all restraint, for thou art home again (17-28) l '

We know nothing more of Pompeius than the ode tells us. Appar-
ently Horace had not seen his friend from the year of Philippi (42 ss.c.)
to the time at which the ode was written3 this was most probably ²9
B.c.‚ when Augustus' mild policy allowed those who had taken arms
against him to return to Italy in safety. Metre‚ 68.

O saepe mecum tempus in ultimum
deducte Bruto militiae duce,

fregi coronatus nitentis
