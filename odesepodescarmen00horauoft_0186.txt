Met e 69 Vlla si iuris tibi peierati

poena, Barine, nocuisset umquam,
dente si nigro fieres vel uno

turpior ungui,

5 · crederem; sed tu simul obligasti
perfidum votis caput, enitescis
pulchrior multo, iuvenumque prodis

publica cura.

Expedit matris cineres opertos
10 fallere et toto taciturna noctis

1. iuris . . . peierati: formed
after the analogy of ius iurandum ,-
equivalent to peiurz'z'.

3 f. dente . . ungui: both
ablatives of degree with turpior.
-si fieres: generalizing‚ if ever.
—nigro . . . uno : with both nouns.
For the arrangement of words see
Intr. 21. The ancients believed
that perjury was punished by
bodily blemish3 and the Greeks
had the same superstition which is
current with us, that white spots
on the nails are caused by lying.

5 f. simul: cf. n. to 1, 4, 17.

— obligasti: for this technical
word, see n. to 2, 7, 17. —votisz

dative, equivalent to devotionibus,

the punishments she has invoked

ished (cf. vv. 2—4), but becomes
all the more brilliant.

7 f. prodis: comest forth, with
thy admirers about thee. —cura:
technically used of the object of
one's love. Cf. Prop. 3, 25, ι
unica nata meo pulcherrima cura

Lycoris. Pindar P. 10, 9² says
of Hippocleas νέαισίν τε παρθέ-
νοισι μέλημα.

9. expedit: sc. te. ‘So far
from perjury harming you, you ac-
tually profit by it.'-—matris fal-
lere, etc. ε to swear fahely by, etc.
