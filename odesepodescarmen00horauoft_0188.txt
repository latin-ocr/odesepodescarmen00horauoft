HORATI

Te suis matres metuunt iuvencis,
te senes parci miseraeque nuper
virgines nuptae, tua ne retardet

aura maritos.

So Horace once made determined
vows, but still returned to his heart-
less Inachia, Epoa’. 1 1, 19—22. Cf.
Tibul. 2, 6, 13 f. iuravi quotiens
rediturum ad limina numquam! Ι
cum bene iuravi, pes tamen ipse
redit.

21ff. te. . .te: Intr. 28 c. Three
classes sear Barine: mothers for
their sons, miserly old men for their
money, and brides for their new
husbands.—iuvencis: their dear

sons. Cf. 2, 5, 6.—-senes parci:
who know she will squeeze their
money bags if once she gets
the chance—miserae: proleptic‚
‘made wretched by their fear.'—
virgines: like puellae, not infre-
quently used of newly married
women. Cf. 3, 14, 11.-tua aura:

tlte breatlz of tlzy clzarm. Cf. 1, 5, ⁴

11 popularis aura, and Propert. 3,
27, 15 si modo clamantis revocave-
rit aura puellae.

Horace exhorts his friend Valgius to give up mourning for his favor-

ite M stes.
‘villinter rains and winds are not eternal‚ Valgius. It is not always
the gloorny season. Yet you weep without ceasing (1—12). Not so did

Nestor mourn for his Antilochus, nor Troilus' relatives for his loss. Give ⁷

up your weak plaints, and rather sing the triumphs of Augustus Caesar
(13-24)-'

The reproof at the end runs into a celebration of the Emperor's deeds, ·
and shows the court poet. The name Augustus (v. 19) proves that the ’-
,ἀᾶῖε of composition is later than 27 Bc, but it cannot be more exactly ·1

fixed. See, however, notes to vv. :zo ff.

C. Valgius Rufus, consul suffectus in 12 B.c., was an elegiae poet '1

belonging to Maecenas' circle. According to the Scholiast‚ Vergil al—
ludes to his elegiae verses in E. 7, 22. An epic was apparently expected

from him. Pseudo-Tibul. 4, ῐ, 179 f. est tibi, qui possit magmis· se acciu: ἲ

gere rebus, 1 Valgius: aeterno propior non alter Homero. We hear

also of his rhetorical and medical works, but none of his writings are γ 3
preserved to us. His friendship with Horace is further attested by S. ,.
