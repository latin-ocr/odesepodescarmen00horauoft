CARMINA

[2, 9, 10

Non semper imbres nubibus hispidos
manant in agros aut mare Caspium
vexant inaequales procellae
usque, nec Armeniis in oris,

ς amice Valgi, stat glacies iners
mensis per omnis aut Aquilonibus
querceta Gargani laborant
et foliis viduantur orni:

tu semper urges flebilibus modis
10 Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero

1 ff. For the careful arrangement
of words, see Intr. 28 c. — non
semper, etc. : cf. 2, 11, 9, and Her-
rick‚ ‘Clouds will not ever poure
down rain; Ι Α sullen day will
cleere again. Ι F irst, peales of
thunderwe must heare, Ι Then lutes
and harpes shall stroke the eare.' —-
hispidos: unkempt and dank3 τῖε.
covered with stubble (cf. 4, 10, 5)
and drenehed by the winter's rains.
The comparison is between such
fields and Valgius' countenance.

2. mare Caspium: the stormy
eharacter of this sea is mentioned
by Mela 3, 5 mare Caspium omne
atrox, saevum, sine portubus, pro-
cellis undique expositum. It is
probable‚ however, that Horace's
choice of this concrete example and
of Armeniis in oris (cf. n. to 1, 1,
14) was determined by the coming
reference to Augustus' successful
diplomacy in the East (vv. 20—24).

af. inaequales: gusty, squally.
-usquez temporal, as 1, 17, 4.—

Armeniis in oris: tle. on Mount
Taurus.

5. stat: expressive of the sta—
bility of the glacier- -—- glacies iners:
cf. 4, 7, 12 bruma iners.

7f. Gargani: with this Horace
returns to Italy for his example.
Garganus is a thickly wooded
mountain in Apulia, especially ex-
posed to storms. Cf. Epist. 2,
1, 202 Garganum mugire putes
nemus aut mare Tuscum. — quer-
ceta . . . laborant: cf. 1, 9, 3silvae
laborantes.—viduantur: are wicl-
owed os} the climax of his figures
of desolation. The temporal idea.
varied by semper usque, mensis per
omnis, continues to the end of the
second strophe.

9 f. tu semper: contrasted with
Nature—urges: pum-uest, dwell-
est on,- used by Propertius (5, 11,
1) as if the mourning distressed
the dead, desine, Paulle, meum la-
crimis urgere sepulcrum.

10 ff. vespero surgente, etc.: so
