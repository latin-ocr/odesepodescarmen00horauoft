HORATI

surgente decedunt amores
nec rapidum fugiente solem.

At non ter aevo functus amabilem
ploravit omnis Antilochum senex
15 annos, nec impubem parentes
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores

flevere semper: desine mollium
tandem querellarum, et potius nova

Orpheus mourned for his lost Eu—
ridice, Verg. G. 4, 466 te veniente
die, te decedente canebat. Cf. Hel-
vius Cinna's lines, te matutinus
flentem conspexit Eous Ι et flentem
paulo wdz't post Hesperus idem,·
and Tennyson's Alaricum, ‘Her
tears fell with the dews of even; Ι
Her tears fell ere the dews were
dried.'——amores: z'.e. his elegies. —
rapidum: placed in contrast with
fugiente. It is a stock epithet of
the sun. Cf. Mimn. 10, 5 ὠκέος
Ἠελίοιο ἀκτῖνες, and Verg. G. 1,
92 rapidive potentia solis.

13ff. ter aevo functus: Nestor,
described ll. 1, 250 ff. τῷ δ’ ἤδη
δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων Ι
ἐφθίαθ’, οῗ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα τράφεν
ἠδ’ ἐγένοντο Ι ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ, μετὰ
δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν. Cf. Cic.
C. M. 31 tertiam enim aetatem lzomi-
num videbat—amabilem: placed
here with adversative force, in spite
of all ln‘s loveliness. Cf. impubem
(v. 15), a mere child. The two adjec-
tives doubtless are chosen as apply-
ing also to Mystes, whom Valgius
has lost.-—non ploravit omnis an-

nos: when, in the anssey, Te-
lemachus and his companion visit
Nestor at his home in Pylus, they
find him cheerful in spite of the

loss of his son Antilochus, whom --

Memnon slew.-Troilon: Priam's
young son, whom Achilles caught
and slew near a spring. This was
a favorite scene with vase painters
of the early fifth century (Baum. p.
1901 f.). Troilus' sister Polyxena ”
is frequently represented as wit·

nessing his death. His fate was in -

poets the type of early death τ, cf.
eg Verg. Α . 1, 474 ff„ where indeed
Vergil is describinga wall painfing,

and Chaucer, T. and C. 5, 1806 ’
‘(Troilus) dispitously him slough χ

the fiers Achille?

17. desine. . . querellarum: this ἕ
construction with the genitive of ς

separation is in imitation of Greek
usage with λήγω, παύομαι, etc. Cf.
3, 17, 16 operum solutis ,· 3, 27, 69
abstineto irarum.

18f. nova tropaea: whatsuccesses
are meant is uncertain. Some think ⁹.
of Augustus* campaigns against the ,ἐ

Cantabri, 27-2 5 13.c. ; others regard
