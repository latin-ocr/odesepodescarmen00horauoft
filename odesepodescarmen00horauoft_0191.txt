cantemus Augusti tropaea
20 Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten

Medumque flumen gentibus additum
victis minores volvere vertices,
intraque praescriptum Gelonos
exiguis equitare campis.

tropaea as a general term, defined
by what follows—Niphaten, Me-
dum flumen. . .volvere, Gelonos . . .
equitare. It is probable, however,
that Horace had no definite victo-
ries in mind, but wished to say,
‘Come‚ Valgius, let us turn to epic
song; our subject is ready—Au-
gustus' new successes (in general)
and (in particular) the NiphateS,'
etc.

ao ff. These were victories of
diplomacy rather than of arms.—
rigidum: ice-bound. — Niphaten:
according to Strabo and Dio Cas-
sius, a mountain of Armenia. But
Lucan3, 245 and Sil. Ital. 13, 765 and
luv. 6, 409 consider it a river. Verg.
G. 3, 30 celebrates the same exten-
δίου of the empire‚ addam urbes
Asiae domitas pulsumque lViplza-
tem—nedum flumen: the Euphra-
tes. The construction changes
from the simple accusative to the
accusative and infinitive, ‘sing the

Niphates, sing that‚' etc. Proper-
tius has a similar construction, 2,
1, 19 ff. non ego Titanas canerem,
non Ossan Olympo Ι inpositam, ut
caeli Pelion esset iter Ι . . . Xerxis
et imperio bina coisse vada—mi-
nores: in token of its submission.
Cf. Verg. A. 8, 726 Euphrates ibat
iam mollior undis.

23. Gelonos: a nomad Scythian
people on the river Don. The
poets of this time, however, use
their name for the Scythians in
general.—exiguis: for they are
now limited intra praescriptum. ——
equitare: ride tlzeir raids. Cf. 1,
2, 51. The reference in the last
two verses is probably to an em-
bassy from the Scythians which
Augustus received at Tarraco in
Spain. Cf. Mon. Anc. 5, 51 nostram
amicitiam petierunt per legatos
Bastarnae Scythaeque et Sarma-
tarum qni sunt citra flumen T a-

naimydra reges.

A series of sententiae on the dangers of high and low estate and the
advantages of the golden mean, which should be compared with 2, 2 and
