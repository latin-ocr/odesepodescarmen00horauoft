Horace will teach his friend Hirpinus his own philosophy.

HORATI

⁴ Little

is enough for life, enjoy the present fleeting moment with no thought
of distant dangers, no greed for useless wealth. Youth quickly flies,
and old age comes. All is change. How useless then to vex our souls

with endless aims and efforts)

Quinctius Hirpinus, apparently the friend to whom Epist. 1, 16 is
addressed, is not further known. He seems to have been ambitious for
wealth, but not averse to pleasures. The date of composition is proba-
bly fixed as 26-25 B.c. by the mention of the bellicosus Cantaber v. 1.

Metre, 68. Quid bellicosus Cantaber et Scythes,
Hirpine Quincti, cogitet Hadria
divisus obiecto, remittas
quaerere nec trepides in usum
5 poscentis aevi pauca. Fugit retro

levis iuventas et decor, arida

1 ff. Cantaber: cf. n. to 2, 6,
2.—Hirpine Quincti: for the trans-
position of nomen and cogno-
men, see n. to 2, 2, 3.——Hadria
divisus obiecto: as a matter of
fact, not simply the Adriatic, but
long traets of land and sea sepa-
rated the Scythians from Italy3
but Quinctius was too anxious
over these distant dangers, and
Horace playfully exaggerates —
‘set off from us only by,' etc.
The danger of a barbarian inva-
sion from the northeast was not
sufficiently present to the Roman
mind at this time to cause Horace
to speak seriously of the barrier
the Adriatic would afford. In
later centuries‚ however, this sea
often protected Italy.—remittas
quaerere: cf. 1, 38, 3 mitte sec-

tari‚· 3, 29, 11 omitte mirari.
There is probably also the acces-

sory idea of relaxing the anxious '

strain. We may translate, give up
tlzy anxious questionz'ng. Cf. Ter.
And. 827 remittas iam me onerare
iniuriz's. - trepides in usum: and
do not fret about the needs, etc.
Cf. 1, 9, 14 f.; 3, 29, 32 f.

5-12. The thought is a com-
monplace. Cf. Theog. 985 f. αἶψα
γὰρ ὥστε νόημα παρέρχεται ἀγλαὸς
ἥβη · Ι οὖδή ἵππων ὁρμὴ γίνεται
ὠκυτέρη. ‘ For quick as thought
bright youth passes 3 horses' speed
is not swifter.' Auson. Antlt. Lat.
646 colltge virgo rosas, dum flos
novus et nova pubes, Ι et memor esto
aevum sic properare tuum ‚- and,
‘Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Ι Old Time is lstill a-flying‚ Ι And
