HORATI

Saturni veteris; tuque pedestribus
10 dices historiis proelia Caesaris,
Maecenas, melius ductaque per vias
regum colla minacium.

Me dulcis dominae Musa Licymniae
cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum
15 fulgentis oculos, et bene mutuis
fidum pectus amoribus;

quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris
nec certare ioco nec dare bracchia

9f. tuque: emphatically intro-
ducing the speeific reason why
Horace cannot celebrate Caesar's
deeds, —— ⁴ And then you will tell‚'
ete—pedestribus . . . historiis:
prose, in contrast to poetry. Hor-
ace was the first to adopt this term,
in imitation of the Greek πεζὸς
λόγος. There is no evidence that
Maecenas ever undertook such a
work as Horace here suggests.

11 f. ducta: zie. in the trium-
phal procession. — colla: ‘with
chains about their necks.' Cf.
Epoa'. 7, 7 f. intactus aut Britan-
nus ut descenderet 1 sacra catena-
tus via, and Prop. 2, Ι, 33 f. with
reference likewise to Augustus'
triumphs (canerem) regum auratis
circumdata colla catenis 1 Actiaque
in sacra currere rostra via. -mi-
nacium: but just now threatening.

13· me . . . me: ‘My task is
this) Intr. 30.—d0minae: this
became under the empire the
regular title of address to a mar-

ried woman, like our ‘Mrs.‚'
‘Madam‚’ the Italian ‘donna-⁹
Translate, my lady. - Licymniae:
ancient critics agreed that und&
this name Terentia, Maecenan'
wife, is meant. The fact that tho
two names are metrically identioet
makes this very probable. Se
Catullus calls Clodia, Lesbia3 Tl-
bullus employs Delia for Plania,
etc. That Licymnia in any casa
was a free-born Roman lady ‘u
proved by v. 19 f. See note.-
cantus: modified by dulcis.-—-.
bene: connect with fidum. Cf. Cic.
