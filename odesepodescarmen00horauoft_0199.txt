ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro
’ . ιο Dianae celebris die.

Num tu quae tenuit dives Achaemenes

aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes

permutare velis crine Licymniae,
plenas aut Arabum domos,

quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,

relaxed enough at this time to allow
dancing within one's own house, and
the reference here may be to such
private amusement. Cf. 3, 6, 21 and
n.—nec . . . dedecuit: cf. Ovid.
Am. 1, 7, 12 nec dominam motae
dedecuere comae. —certare ioco : ie.
in light conversation. — dare brac-
chia: rhythmical movements of the
arms formed an important part of
ancient dances, as they still do,
e.g. in the Italian tarantella.

= the founder of the royal house of

Persia. Cf. 3, 1‚44.—Mygdonias:
Mygdon was an early king of

a lock of hair. For the construc-
tion, see Intr. 98.—plenas . . .
Arabum domos: cf. 3, 24, 1f. in-

her sternness (saevitia) is easily
overcome. — poscente: dependent
on magis. ‘Don't ask her for
kisses, she would take more satis-
faction in having them stolen from
her than the one (zze. you, Mae-
cenas) who begs them would
delight to get them: indeed she
would sometimes begin by steal-
ing thern from you.' Cf. Tibul.
