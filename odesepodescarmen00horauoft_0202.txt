HORATI

robur: sed improvisa leti
20 vis rapuit rapietque gentis.

Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae
et iudicantem vidimus Aeacum
sedesque discriptas piorum et
Aeoliis fidibus querentem

25 Sappho puellis de popularibus,
et te sonantem plenius aureo,
Alcaee, plectro dura navis,
dura fugae mala, dura belli.

— sed inprovisa: emphatic, still it
is tlte mzexpected, etc.

21 ff. Horace returns to reflec—
tions on his own possible fate and
to thoughts of the shades he would
have seen in the lower world.
As a poet he would desire to be-
hold his great models, Sappho and
Alcaeus3 exactly as Socrates. in
his cheerful anticipation of Hades
(Plat. Apol. 40E—41C), wished
to meet Palamedes, Ajax son of
Telamon, and all others who had
been victims of unjust judgments
like himself. — furvae : dusky, the
proper epithet for regna, here
transferred to Queen Proserpina.
Intr. 99. Seneca had the same
thought in mind when he wrote H.
F. 547 ff. qua spe praecipites actus
ad inferos Ι audax ire vias inre-
meabiles 1 vidisti Siculae regna
Proserpinae? — Proserpinae : here
the first syllable is short, but ordi-
narily it is long. Cf. 1, 28, 20. ——
Aeacum: with Minos and Rhada-
manthus, judge of the dead.

23 f. sedes discriptas: homes
set aparl (separatas), τῖε. from the
place of punishment. So Vergil
A. 8, 670 has secretos pios. Note
the order of progress: the throne
of Proserpina, the judgment seat,
and after that the Elysian fields.

—Aeoliisz the Aeolic dialect was ·

the speech of Lesbos, the home
of Horace’s chief models, Sappho
and Alcaeus, so that this adjective
instant! y suggestedto the educated

Roman these two poets. — queren- ’

tem, etc.: because the maidens
of her city were so cold in love.
25 ff. Sappho: accusative.—
sonantem plenius: sounding a
fuller strain. Alcaeus sang of
war and exile, as well as love.—
aureo . . . plectro: instrumental
abl. The adjective marks the
splendor of Alcaeus' song. Cf.
Quint. 10. 1, 63 Alcaeus in parte

operis aureo plectro merito dona· ἔ

tur. -- fugae : exile. For the triple

anaphora dura, dura, dura, see
