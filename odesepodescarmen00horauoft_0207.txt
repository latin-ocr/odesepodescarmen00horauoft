A protest against the increasing luxury of the timess ‘Palaces and
fish ponds now leave little ground for cultivation3 vineyards and or-
chards have given way to shade trees and fiower beds. It was very
different in the good old days, when private fortunes were small and
men's first care was for the state3 then private houses were not great3
public buildings and temples only were of marble.'
