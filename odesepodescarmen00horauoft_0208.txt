HORATI

ἓ Such protests are common to all times of wealth and luxury. Another
ξ example is 3, 6. Augustus tried to restrain the growth of private extrava-
ξ’ gance, and to restore the agricultural prosperity of Italy. Some editors
1 have wished, therefore, to connect this ode with the date (28 Rc.) at
i which Octavian assumed the duties of censor, and indeed it is quite pos-
sible that it was written at the emperor's request. The verses are stiff,
and bear the marks of being made to order. The position here after
14, from which in some manuscripts it is not separated, is a natural one,
for it continues the attack on the folly of great wealth. The ode is,
however, wholly impersonal, not even the indefinite second person being
j used, and lacks the poetica] quality of 14. Metre, 68.

Iam pauca aratro iugera regiae

extenta visentur Lucrino
stagna lacu, platanusque caelebs

myrtus et omnis copia narium

1 ff. Cf. with the the general sen-
timent of the ode Seneca Epist. 89,
21 quousque nullus erit lacus, cm'
non villarum vestrarum fastzgia
immineant, nullum flumen, cuius
non rzpas aedfficza vestra prae-
texant? . . . ubicumque in aliquem
sinum litus curvabitur vos proti-
nus fundamenta facietis, nec con-
tenti solo, nisi quod manu feceritis,
mare agetis introrsus (cf. C . 2, 183
3, 24).—regiae moles: tle. the pal-
aces of the rich. Cf. n. to 2, 14,
11, also 3, 29, 10, where Maecenas'
city house is called molem propin-
quam nubibus arduis.

3f. visentur: will be seen with
wonder.— Lucrino . . . lacu: near
Baiae, famous for its oysters and
fish. Cf. n. to Epod. 2, 49. —stagnaz
piscinae, in which the fish dear

to Roman epicures were raised.—

platanus caelebs: during the last ·

century Bc. the plane tree became
a favorite for parks and gardens.
Cf. 2, 11, 13. The thick shade
which its broad leaves cast made
it unsuited as a support for the
vine—therefore called caelebs. Cf.
n. to Epod. 2, 10. Martial‚ 3, 58,
3, names it vidua platanus.

5. evincet: slzall drive out.—
violaria: violet beds,· with the myr-
tle —-a flowerin g shrub —and other
sweet-smelling flowers, typical of
luxury.

off. omnis copia narium: all tlte
wealtlz (of flowers) thatfilh tlte nos-

pression for odor, used here to hint
at Horace's dislike for such elabo-
rate flower gardens. —olivetisz lo-
