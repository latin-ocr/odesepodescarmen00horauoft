spargent olivetis odorem

tum spissa ramis laurea fervidos

Non ita Romuli

praescriptum et intonsi Catonis
, auspiciis veterumque norma.

cative ablative. —fertilibusz predi-
cate, that were productive. With
the preceding, cf. Quintilian's ques-
tion, 8, 3, 8 an ego fundum cul—
tiorem putem, in quo milti quis
ostenderit lilia et violas et anemo-
nas, fontes surgentes, quam ubi
plena messis aut graves fructu
vites erunt? sterilem platanum
tonsasque myrtos quant maritam
ulmum et uberes oleas praeoptave-
rim?

gf. ramis: instrumental abl.
'rhe laurel was trimmed into fan-
cisul shapes, and grew thick and
close (spissa). —:1aurea sc. arbor.
-iotusz sc. solen—non ita, etc.:
‘it was different in the good old
days.'—-Romuli: like Catonis, modi-
sying auspiciis.

11. praescriptum: sc. est. —Ca-
tonis: Cato the Censor, who died
149 13.c.‚ devoted his best efforts to
an attempt to stern the modern

Hellenizing tendencies of his time:
as a sign of his conservatism he is
said to be bearded‚ like Curius in ι,
12, 41. He became typical of the
stem, old-fashioned Roman.—au-
spiciis: tlte example. The auspicia
could be taken only by high magis-
trates, so that the sentence means
—‘when men like a Romulus or a
Cato ruled the state.'

13 f. census: income—brevis:
τῖε. the record of their property
was short. -— nulla, ete.: i.e. as
nowadays. — decempedis: survey-
ors' rods. perticae, used in measur-
ing the new-fashioned porticoes of
private citizens—privatis: gram-
matically connected with decempe-
dis, but emphasizing the fact that
these are private buildings.

16. excipiebat: caught, zze.
opened to the cool north.

171'. fortuitum: the first chance
turs that came to hand, opposed
