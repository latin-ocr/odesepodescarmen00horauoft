pire. PlinyN. H. 36, 48 says that
Mamurra, in the time of Julius
Caesar, was the first Roman to
use marble slabs for lining the
walls of his house, but marble
columns had been used in private
houses for half a century before
this date. On the changes in the
appearance of Rome during Au-
gustus' reign, cf. his famous state-

marble is meant, which came into
use for private dwellings only in
the last half-century before the em-

ment (Suet. Aug. 28) marmoream
se relinquere (urbem), quam la· ’
tericiam accepisset. ”

A collection of sententiae on Horace's favorite theme: ‘a contented
spirit is beyond all other possessions.⁷

‘Peace is the prayer of all men—the sailor on the stormy sea, the ,
warlike Thracian and Mede. Peace thou canst not buy. N either wealth
nor power will drive away men's wretched cares. He only lives well who
lives on little, undistressed by sear or greed. Why should we move
from land to land and put forth our weak efforts? Care follows hard

upon us. No, life is mingled sweet and bitter, and all things have their ν

compensation. Perhaps the flitting hour gives me something thou hast
not. For thee an hundred herds low, thou hast thy stud and royal pur-
ple3 yet Ι possess my little farm, a slight inspiration for Greek verse,
and the power to scorn the envious.'

The Grosphus here addressed is probably the same Pompeius Gros-

phus recommended by Horace, Epist. 1, 12, 22-24, to his friend Iccius π’

(cf. introduction to 1, 29), when the latter was managing Agrippa's
estates in Sicily. That Grosphus also had large possessions there is
evident from vv. 33-37, but that he was stilla man who could appreciate
Horace's expansion of his life's text may be a sair conclusion from the

character given him in the epistle mentioned above, nil nisi verum κ

orabit et aequum.

The exact date of composition cannot be determined‚ but the men· '⁴

tion of Thrace and the Medes may point to a date before 27 13.c. In
