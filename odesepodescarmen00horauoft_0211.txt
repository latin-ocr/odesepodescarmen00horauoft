[2, 16, 10

July of that year M. Licinius Crassus enjoyed a triumph over the Thra-
dans and Getae. In any case the verses came from the time when

Horace felt his happiness secured and his position as lyric poet sure, so

Otium divos rogat in patenti
prensus Aegaeo, simul atra nubes
condidit lunam neque certa fulgent

sidera nautis;

5 otium bello furiosa Thrace,
otium Medi! pharetra decori,
Grosphe‚ non gemmis neque purpura ve-

nale neque auro.

Non enirn gazae neque consularis
xo submovet lictor miseros turnultus
