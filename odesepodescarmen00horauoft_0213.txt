[2, 16, 32

Scandit aeratas vitiosa navis
Cura nec 'turmas equitum relinquit,
ocior cervis et agente nimbos

ocior Euro.

‘oderit curare, et amara lento
{temperet risu : nihil est ab omni

parte beatum.

Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem, Ι
· 30 longa Tithonum minuit senectus,
et mihi forsan tibi quod negarit

porriget hora.

Sen. Epist. 28, 2 quaeris, quare
te suga nicta non adiuvet ,θ lecum
fiagisf and Emerson Seff-Reli-
unce, ‘I pack my trunk . . . and
at last wake up in Naples‚ and
⁴ there beside me is the stern fact,
the sad self, unrelenting, identi-

21-24. An amplification of the
>preceding two verses—‘neither
ship nor horse is swift enough to
‘escape pursuing care.' The same
idm is better expressed 3, 1, 37 ff.
ff-aeratas : bronze—beaked. ——- viti-

Odor: emphasizing the swiftness
nith which care moves. Intr. 28c.

que severa. — oderit: subjunctive,
shrink from. — lento: quiet, as
befits a man who knows how to
meet life's changes.

29 ff. Concrete illustration of
the general statement in v, 27 f.
—clarum: glorians. N otice its
position next to cita mors, ‘for
all his glory death came quickly.'

30. The opposite fate of Titho-
nus. Cf. n. to 1, 28, 8.——longa:
i.e. aeterna, as 2, 14, 19.

31 f. et mihi: Horace here, as
frequently, drives home his state-
ments by personal illustrations at
the close. The following two
strophes give the details of the
bold comparison between himself
and Grosphus. The contrast is
modestly put, but the poet's pride
rings in the last words, malignum
spernere volgus. — tibi : with nega-
rit.——hora: tlte chance lzour.
