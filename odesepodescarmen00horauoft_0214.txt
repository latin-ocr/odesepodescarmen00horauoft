IIORATI

Te greges centum Siculaeque circum
mugiunt vaccae, tibi tollit hinnitum

murice tinctae

vestiunt lanae: mihi parva rura et
spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae
Parca non mendax dedit et malignum

33—36. ‘te . . . tibi . . . te:
making Grosphus* wealth promi-
nent in comparison with Horace's
parva rura—centum: like mille
a round number. — hinnitum :
wltz'nny. For the hypermetric
verse, see Intr. 69. —— equa: cf.
Verg. G. 1, 59 Eliadum palmas

. . equarum. —bis . . . tinc-
tae: twice dyed, the Greek δίβαφα,
atechnlcal term Cf. Epod. 12‚21
muricibus Tyriis iteratae vellera
lanae. -Afro murice: the shell-
fish from which the scarlet dye was
obtained was found on the coast of
Africa as well as on the southern
shore of the Peloponnesus.

37 f. Note the modest parva,
tenuem. For the meaning of the

latter here, cf. 1, 6, 9 nec conamur
tenues grandia. -- spiritum: in-
spiration. — Camenae ε identified
completely with the Greek Μοῦσα.

39 f. non mendax: who does
not deceive, true. A stock epi-
thet. Cf. C. S. ²5 veraces ceci—
nisse l’arcae. Pers. 5, 48 Parca
tenax veri. — spernere : in the
same construction as rura, spiri-

tum. Horace's rise in‘the world '

aroused much envy and ill-natured
comment among those of better
birth but poorer talents. That
he was sensitive to this is shown by
his references here and elsewhere,
and his pride is most natural. Cf.
2. 20. 4 invidia maior, and n.

The following ode seems to have been called forth by Maeeenas'
gloomy sorebodings that his end was near. He was a great sufferet

from insomnia and sever, but shrank from death.

The verses open with

a rebuke‚ but presently become an assurance os the deepest affection:
the very gods have willed that the poet shall not outlive his friend.
Moreover, the hour set by the Fates is not yet come, else Maecenas had
not recovered from his last illness and Faunus had not saved Horace from
the falling tree. So then they both must offer to the gods the sacrificesdue.
