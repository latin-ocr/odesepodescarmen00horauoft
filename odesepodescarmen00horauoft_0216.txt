20 Hesperiae Capricornus undae,

oath of allegiance to his com-
mander, by which he bound him-
self to follow wherever he might
lead—ibimus, ibimus: the repe-
tition marks Horace's earnestness.
lntr. 28a. — utcumque: temporal,
as always in Horace. Cf. ι’, 17, 10.

¹3 f. chimaerae: cf. n. to 1, 27,
23. —igneae: cf. Pindar 0, 13, 90
χίμαιραν πῦρ πνέοισαν. ——— si resur—
gat: i.e. from beneath the earth to
confront me. —Gyas : like Briareus
(ll. 1, 401-405) a hundred-handed
giant, son of Uranus and Earth.

15 f. divellet: sc. a te.—Iusti-
tiae: the Greek Themis.—placi-
tumque: for the position of the
conjunctim, see Intr. 31.

17 ff. ‘ It matters not what stars
presided over my natal hour, our
horoscopes agree in marvelous
fashion.' This reference to as-
trology is an indulgence to Mae-
cenas' belief in the art. for Horace
had no saith in the numeri of the
Babylonians (Ι, 11).—- Scorpios
. . . formidulosus: the adjective

is apt, for under this sign warriors
were born. Cf. Manil. 4, 220 f.
in bellum ardentis animos et Mar-
tia castra Ι efficit (sc. Scorpios) et
multum gaudentem sanguine
civem. Libra, however, gave a
more favorable destiny. Cf. Manil.
4, 548 felix aequato genitus sub*
pondere Librae! -— adspicit: the
present is used since astrologers
taught that the constellation which
presided over the child's birth
affected him through life.—pars
violentior: tlte member (any one
of the three constellations named)
with greater poemen—tyrannm,
etc.: the various quarters of the
earth were assigned to the differ-
ent signs of the zodiac3 the sys-
tem of astrology current in the
early empire gave Capricornus
the western part of the world.
Cf. M anil. 4, 791 ff. tu, Capricorne,
regis, quicquid sub sole cadente Ι
est positum, gelidamque Helicen
quod tangit ab illo, Ι Hispanas
gentes et quot fert Gallia dives.
