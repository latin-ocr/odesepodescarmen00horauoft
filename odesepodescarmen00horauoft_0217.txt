CARMINA

[2, 17, 30

utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
consentit astrum: te Iovis impio
tutela Saturno refulgens
eripuit volucrisque fati

²5 tardavit alas, cum populus frequens
⁷ laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum;
me truncus inlapsus cerebro
sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum

dextra levasset, Mercurialium
30 custos virorum. Reddere victimas

αι ff. utrumque, etc.: cf. n.to v.
8above. ——consentit2 the passage
is imitated by Persius 5, 45 f. non
equidem hoc dubites, amborum
> foedere certo Ι consentire dies et
ab uno sidere duci. — te : the con-
trasted me follows v. 27. ‘Thou
art under the protection of supreme
Jove.’ Possibly in Maecenas'
horoscope Jupiter was in the as-
cendant. —impio . . . Saturno:
connect with both refulgens and
eripuit. According to the as-

‘fi'ology of the time Saturn's influ- ’

enee was baneful. Cf. Prop. 5, 1,
84 grave Saturni sidus in omne
capum and our ‘jovial ' and ‘sat-
umine.‘—refulgens: flaslzing out
agm‘nst. Jupiter offsets Saturn's
power to harm.

²4- volucris: with alas—fati:
here equivalent to mortis. Cf. S.
2, 1, 58 seu mors atris circumvo-

25 f. cum . . . crepuit: the
date was 30 13.c. For the occa-

sion, see n. to 1, 20, 4. -theatrisz

locative abl.—ter: a stock num-
ber. Cf. Prop. 4, 9, 4 Camenae

. . manibus faustos ter crepuere
sonos.

27 f. me truncus, etc.: cf. 2,
13.—sustu1erat: the indicative
emphasizes the certainty of Hor-
ace's fate which was suddenly
averted by Faunus. Cf. 3, 16, 3.

28 f. Faunus: the kindly wood-
land spirit, who loved to visit
Horace's farm and to care for his
flocks (ι, 17), is named here as
protector. The Muses hold this
position 3, 4, 273 Liber 3, 8, 7. —
Mercurialium, etc.: Mercury as
god of speech and inventor of the
lyre (3, 11, 1 ff.) is here made the
guardian of poets. Ordinarily the
phrase means the devotees of Mer-
cury, the god of gain, as S. 2, 3,
24 f. hortos egregiasque domos
mercarier unus Ι cum lucro noram .·
unde frequentia [Mercuriale Ι in-
posuere milei cognomen compita.

30. reddere: to pay, because
the offering vowed is due the gods.
