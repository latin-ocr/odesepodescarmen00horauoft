2, 17, 3¹] HORATI

aedemque votivam memento;
nos humilem feriemus agnam.

Cf. 2. 7, 17 ergo obligatam redde
lovc'clapem. — victimas: Le. many
large cattle.

32. humilem . . . agnam: in
playful reference to the difference

in their estate. So Horace says
(4. 2. 53 f.) to his rich fn'end
Julius Antonius te decem tauri
tandemque vaccae, Ι me tener sol-
vet vitulus.

‘No lordly pile or fortune great is mine, but a kind poetic gift, a
little farm, are all that Ι possess. 'Tis quite enough for me. But you,
though life is insecure, still build your palaces and grudge the very
sea its shore3 you drive your poor clients from their homes that you
may satisfy your greed for land. Your sure home is the halis of Death;
Earth's doors open sor rich and poor alike. No bribes move the grim
terryman.'

This ode handles again Horace's favorite theme—the vanity of
riches and ambition‚ the wisdom of the golden mean. The same senti—
ments are expressed 1, 31 ; 2, 163 3, 1, 40—48. 24, 1 ff. As frequently

elsewhere he takes his own case as an illustration of the ideal lot, in '

which man is content with his moderate estate, and contrasts it with
that of the rich man whose greed defies the sacred laws of nature and
of man. Horace has no individual in mind, but with his fondness for
concrete statement gives his verses a dramatic turn by the direct form
of address. His model may have been a poem of Bacchylides, Frg. 21
Β1. οὐ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, Ιόὗτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες, Ι
ἀλλὰ θυμὸς εὐμενής Ι Μοῦσά τε γλυκεῖα. καὶ ,Βοιωτίοισιν Ι ἐν σκύφοισιν
οἶνος ἡδύς. The date of composition is uncertain. Metre (only here),
82.
Non ebur neque aureum

mea renidet in domo lacunar,

 

1-5. Horace has in mind the
splendid atria adorned with rare
marbles which the rich had begun
to build toward the end of the Re-
public. Cf. n. to 2, 15, 20.—
ebur: equivalent to the prose

eburneum ‚- ivory and gold were
used to adorn the paneis (lacu-
naria) of the atrium. Cf. Lucr.
2, 27 f. nec domus argento fulget
auroque renidet Ι nec citharae re-
boant laqueata aurataque tecta.
