benigna vena est, pauperemque dives
me petit: nihil supra

deos lacesso nec potentem amicum

largiora flagito,

satis beatus uni‘cis Sabinis.

3 f. The architraves of this
splendid atrium are made of the
bluish white marble from Mt. Hy—
mettus; the columns of yellow
giallo antico from Numidia.

5 f. · neque Attali. etc. : the in—

*heritance of great fortunes by per-
sons not related to the testator
was already known in Horace's
day. In the following century
inheritance hunting became a busi-
noes. The ancient commentators
believed that Horace here ex-
pressed his disapproval of the in-
heritance by the Romans of King
Attalus' wealth in 5333. Whether
this be true or not, it is certain
that many of the conservative Ro-
mans dated the introduction of
luxury and the consequent degen-
eracy at Rome from this time.—

κὶ ignotum i.e. to the testator. The
heir has no right to the fortune he
greedily senes—occupavi: note
the greed expressed in this word.

7 f. ‘Nor am 1 so rich that I
have high-born clients to spin me
robes dyed with the purple)—
Laconicas: the murex from which
the purple dye was obtained was
found in great abundance on the
shore of the island Cythera and
along the Laconian coast.

9 f. at: marking the sharp1
transition to what the poet does
possess. - benigna z kindly. ——l
pauperemque, etc. : instead os a
going to the rich man's house to,¹

l

give him the morning greeting 's

(salutatio), Horace is visited in
his humble home by the rich who Δ
honor his poetic talent.

12. lacesso: vex witlz my dc-
mands‚· with two accusatives as ⁴
a verb of asking. — amicum: Mae· f
cenas, as is shown by v. 14.

14. satis beatus z enrichecl
enough ,· beatus has here an original
participial sense. Cf. Epod. 1, 31 s.
satis superque me bemjgrnitas tua Ι
