novaeque pergunt interire lunae:
tu secanda marmora
locas sub ipsum funus, et sepulcri

ditavit. —unicis Sabinis: my one
dear Sabine farm. For this mean-
ing of unicus, cf. 3, 14, 5 unico
marito.

15 ff. ‘Time hurries on, and
< yet you are unmindful of your ap-
proaching end.' — truditur ; cf.
Epod. 17⁷ 2 5 urget diem nox et dim
noctem, and also Petron. 45 quod
hodie non est, cras erit.- sic vita
truditur. — interire: Intr. 107.

dificia alia ponere, alia subvertere
et mare summovere.—-parum: cf.
