the boundary stone without war-
rant was an act of the greatest
impiety. Cf. Paul. p. 368 quma
Pompilius statuit eum qui termi-
num exarasset et zpsum et boves
sacros (accursed) esse ,- and Deu-
¹teronomy, 27, 17 ‘Cursed be he that
removeth his neighbour's land-
mark.'—ultra limites, ete.: the sa-
cred duty of patron toward client
likewise has no weight with such a
man. The laws of the Twelve
'rables condemned the patron

26 ff. salis: cf. revellis v. 24 and

have seen an eviction like this in

finis is feminine only here and
Epod. 17, 36.

30. rapacis Orci: the adjective
is emphatic— the rapacity of Orcus
outdoes that of the greedy rich at
last.

31 f. divitem . . . erum: in sharp
contrast to the position which he
will presently hold. ‘Now thou
art rich and lord, but in Orcus'
home thy riches will not help thee.'
—ultra: τῖε. ‘strive to gain more
than thou now possessest.'—ae-
qua: impartially, without dsztinc-
tion. Cf. ι, 4, 13f. pallida mors
aequo pulsat pede pauperum taber-
nas Ι regumque turris.

34 ff. pueris: equivalent to filiis5
for the metre, cf. Intr. 56.—nec

Prometheus to bribe Charon to
serry him back is referred to only
