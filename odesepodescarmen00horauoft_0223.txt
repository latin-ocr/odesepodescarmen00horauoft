5 Euhoe, recenti mens trepidat metu
plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum

laetatur; euhoe, parce Liber,
parce gravi metuende thyrso!

Fas pervicacis est mihi Thyiadas
ιο vinique fontem lactis et uberes
cantare rivos atque truncis
lapsa cavis iterare mella:

51. The sight of the god has
filled the poet with mingled sear
and joy and raised him to ecstasy‚
in which he joins in the Bacchanal
cry euhoe, euhoe (εὐοῖ). Cf. 2, 11,
17.—trepidat: the sight of a diviu-
ity was always fearful to mortals.
Cf. Il. 20, 131 χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ
φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς. - pleno . . . pec-
' tore: the god possesses him fully.
Cf. 3, 25, 1 quo me, Bacche, rapis
tui plenum? Iuv. 7. 62 satur est
cum dicit Horatius euoe. —turbi-
ι dum: accusative expressing the
manner of his joy3 cf. 2, 12. 14
luendum fulgentis oculos.

71. parce.. .parce: in eager ap-
peals to the god to spare him the
maddening touch of the thyrsus.
-gravi metuende thyrso: cf. 1, 12.
23 metuende certa Phoebe sagitta.

9. fas. . .est, etc.: without fur-
th‘er warning the ecstatic poet be—
gins his song, for the vision has
given him certain inspiration—
pervicacis: the never tir-ing, persis-
tent. Cf. Epod. 17, 14 where the
adJeetive is applied to Achilles.—
Thyiadas: properly the women who

celebrated the ὅργω. in honor of the
g0d3 from θύω, ‘to rush wildly.'
1off. Wine, milk, and honey are
the signs of Bacchus' fructifying
power. The verses were probably
suggested by Euripides' Bacchae
142 f. ῥεῖ δὲ γάλακτι πέδον. ῥεῖ δ’
οἴνῳ, ῥεῖ δὲ μελισσᾶν Ι νέκταρι, also
706ff. ἄλλη δὲ νάρθηκ’ ἐς πέδον
καθῆκε γῆς, Ι καὶ τῇδε κρήνην ἐξ·
ανῆκ’ οἴνου θεός · Ι ὅσαις δὲ λευκοῦ
πώματος πόθος παρῆν, Ι ἄκροισι
δακτύλοισι διαμῶσαι χθόνα Ι γάλ-
ακτος ἑσμοὺς εἶχον· ἐκ δὲ κισσίνων Ι
θύρσων ’γλυκεῖαι μέλιτος ἔσταζον
ῥοαί. ‘One in earth's bosom
planted her reed-wand. Ι And up
there-through the God a wine
fount sent τ Ι And whoso fain would
drink white-foaming draughts, Ι
Scarred with their finger-tips the
breasts of earth, Ι And milk gushed
forth unstinted: dripped the while Ι
Sweet streams of honey from their
ivy-staves.' (Way.) So the chil-
dren of Israel were promised Exod.
3, 8 ‘a good land and a large—a
land flowing with milk and honey.'
-truncis . . . mella: cf. Horace's
