[2‚ 19, 32

Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
unguibus horribilique mala,

25 quamquam choreis aptior et iocis
ludoque dictus non sat idoneus
pugnae ferebaris; sed idem
pacis eras mediusque belli.

Te vidit insons Cerberus aureo

caudam, et recedentis trilingui

ore pedes tetigitque crura.

Hesiodic myth Bacchus, with Her-
cules, gave victory to the gods in
their battle against the giants in
the Phlegraean fields. The story
os this attempt by the giants to
storm heaven was confused with
the older one of the Titans‚ if in—
deed it did not owe its origin to
it.—retorsisti: alliterative with
Rhoetum, expressing the force with
which the giant was thrown back.
——leonis: the god took on the lion's
- firm, as when he was beset by
phetes, who tried to make him
captive. Hom. Hymn 7, 44.
πεί. Bacchus' double nature

——belliz with medius, the earliest
example of this construction imi-
tated from the Greek. It was em-
ployed by later poets, eg. Ovid.
Met. 6, 409 qui locus est iuguli
medius summique lacerti.

29ff. te vidit, etc.: when Bac-
chus descended to Hades to bring
back his mother Semele—te: cf.
n. on tu v. 21.— insons: predicate,
and did no learm to theam—aureo
cornu, etc-z the Greek χρυσόκερως,
κερασφόρος. Here the golden
drinking-horn is meant, rather than
the horn as an emblem of power.
— atterens : wagging. — recedentis ε
as thou wz'tlzdrewest,· opposed to
the god's entrance, implied in te
vidit. -trilingui : cf. 2, 13, 34 where
Cerberus is centiceps. —tetigitque :
Intr. 31.
