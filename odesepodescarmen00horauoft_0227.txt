CARMINA

[2‚ 20, ιο

dilecte Maecenas, Q
nec Stygia cohibebor unda.

Iam iarn residunt cruribus asperae
ιὸ pelles et album mutor in *alitem
''sisperne nascunturque leves
per digitos umerosque plumae.

Iam Daedaleo notior Icaro
visam gementis litora Bospori
15 Syrtisque Gaetulas canorus
ales Hyperboreosque campos.

51. urbis: the plural is more
effective than the simple terram
would have been.—n0n ego. . . non
ego: intensive; Intr. 28c.—pau-
perum sanguis parentum: Horace
never was ashamed of his low birth,
but took a pardonable pride in his
success in raising himself to an
honored position by his own merits.
—vocasz invitest.

ι nfi. These—to us certainly—
tasteless verses may have been
suggested by Eurip. Frg. 911 N.
χρύσεαι δή μοι πτέρυγες περὶ νώτῳ Ι
19)τᾶ σειρήνων πτερόεντα πέδιλα
merui] l βάσομαι τ’ εἷς αἰθέ-
“gn-&ov ἀρθεὶς-Ι Ζηνὶ προσμείξων.
*Golden winds are fastened on my
back and 1 have on the Sirens'
fflnged sandals. I shall go alost
to the aethereal sky to be with
zeus! But Horace has gone far
beyond his model. — iam iam: cf.
ΕΜ. 17, 1.—cruribus: abl. of
place—asperae pelles: the horny
*kin of the bird's legs and claws
hin which his human skin is set—

tling. — superne : with short ultima
as in Lucretius and Epist. 2, 3, 4.

11. leves : in contrast to asperae.

13 f. iam: presently. — notior
Icaro: who gave his name to a sea.
Cf. Ovid. Fasti 4, 283 f. (mare)
Icarium, lapsas ubi perdidit alas Ι
learns et vastae nominafecit aquae.
—visam‚ etc.: ·my fame will ex-
tend to the limits of the world.'—
gementis: cf.Verg. A. 5, 806 cum
. . . gemerent repletiamnes. Soph.
Antzjgr. 592 στόνῳ βρέμουσι δ’ἀντι-
πλῆγες ἀκταί. Ten nyson, ln dlem.
35 ‘the moanings of the homeless
sea.'

15 f. canorus ales: the swans are
called by Callimachus H ymn. in
Del. 252 Μουσάων ὄρνιθες. ἆοιδότα-
τοι πετεηνῶν. Vergil E. 9, 29 says
to his friend. Vare, tuum nomen.
. . . cantantes sublime ferent ad si-
dera cycni. — Hyperboreos ε beyond
the North Wind was a mythical
folk said to live in unbroken peace
and happiness. But Horace means
only the distant North.
