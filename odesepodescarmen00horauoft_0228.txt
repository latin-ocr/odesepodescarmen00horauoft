HORATI CARMINA

Me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus et ultimi
noscent Geloni, me peritus
20 discet Hiber Rhodanique potor.

Absint inani funere neniae
luctusque turpes et querimoniae;
compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
mitte supervacuos honores.

171. ⁴ The barbarous peoples in
the East shall learn to know my
works as well as the Romanized
Spaniard and Gaul.'—me: cf. n.
to 2, 19, 21.—Marsae cohortis: the
Marsi were one of the bravest ltal-
ian peoples. Cf. n. to 1, 2, 39.

191‘. Geloni: cf. n. to 2, 9, 23.-
peritus Hiber, etc.: that Spain and
Gaul had made great advances in
Roman civilization in Horace's day
is shown by the fact that in the first
century A.D. the former country fur-
nished Rome with her most prom-
inent writers—the two Senecas,
Lucan, probably Valerius Flaccus,
Columella, Mela, Quintilian, Mar-
tial, and others; the latter prov-
ince with orators and rhetoricians.
—Rhodani potor: cf. 3, 10, 1 ex-
tremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce,
and ll. 2, 825 πίνοντες ὕδωρ μέλαν
Αἰσήποιο, Τρῶες. The circumlo-

224

cution is frequently employed by
Apoll. Sid. ag. Epist. 4, 17 potor
Mosellae.

21 ff. Possibly suggested by En-
nius' famous epitaph, nemo me da· L
crumis decoret nec funera fletu! ⁷*
faxit. cur ,ἲ volito vivos per ora
virum—inani: for the poet will .
have flown away—neniae: the ¹
mourning chants sung over .the
dead by women hired for that pur-⁶ Ι
pose (praeficae).—luctus turpes: ⁷
disfiguring grief, such as tearing Ξ
the hair, scratching the cheeks‚ and
beating the breast. Ξ

23 f. clamorem: the conclamatio, a.
the last call to the dead. It appar-
ently consisted of a repetition of ⁷
the dead man's name.—su1³erva-‘
euos: for the tomb will not contain ”
the poet's body, and his verse will,
be his lasting memorial, a monu- ,
mentum aere perennius. ἔ
