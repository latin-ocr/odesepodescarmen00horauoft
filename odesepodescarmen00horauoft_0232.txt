17 f. destrictus ensis, etc.: the
reference is to the familiar story of
the sword of Damocles, told by Cic.
Tusa. 5, 61. It here typifies the
uneasy conscience and ever-pres-
ent sear of death that threaten the
wicked3 hence impia cervice—cui:
equivalent to ei cml—Siculae: the
Sicilians were proverbially luxu-
rious, and the adjective is especially
appropriate in connection with the
reference to Damocles. Note that
dapes is by its position contrasted
with impia—‘ No rich banquets

rich man's palace, its aviaries and

instrumental music. The sleep of j
the poor is proverbially sweet. Cf. · ξ

Also, Ecclesiastes 5, 12 ‘The sleep ’ἶ
