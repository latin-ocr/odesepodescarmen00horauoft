3, 3, 07] HORATI

excisus Argivis, ter uxor
capta virum puerosque ploret.'

Non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae: . Α ³
70 quo, musa, tendis? Desine pe‘1·vieax
referre sermones deorum et 5 f,
magna modis tenuare parvis.

69 ff. non hoc, etc.: Horace
suddenly checks his muse with the
warning that his lyre is iocosa and
not suited to such serious themes.
The strophe is a mere device to
close the ode. Cf. 2, 1, 37 ff.
—convenietz the tense implies

Horace begins this ode with a second invocation to the Muses and a
renewed pledge of his loyalty and devotion to thern. It was they who
gave him safe escape at Philippi, protected him from the falling tree,
and rescued him from drowning. Under their guardianship he may -
wander all unharmed among savage tribes on the very outskirts of the
world (1-36). It is also they who protect mighty Caesar and aid him
with gentle counsel (37—42). At this point in the ode Horace turns
with apparent abruptness to the story of the giants' defeat in their
battle with the gods, and closes with a warning against dependence on
brute force and violence (42-80). No Roman. however, would fail to
see that Horace wished to present Augustus here as the vice-regent of} Α
Jove, and that the powers of violence are those of rebellion against the·
emperor's moderate and beneficent rule. In the next ode the compari-
son is more outspoken.

The6d³ate of composition is approximately 26 B.c.: cf. n. to v. 33.

that all has not yet been said.—
pervicax : persistent. — tenuare:
to lessen, dwarf. Cf. 1, 6, 12 de-
terere ; 1, 6, 9 nec . . . conamur,
tenues grandia. Also Prop. 4, ι,
5 dicite, quo pariter carmen tenu-
astis in antro ?

Descende caelo et dic age tibia
regina longum Calliope melos,

1 ff. descende caelo: for the
Muses dwell on Olympus, ll. 2,
484 Μοῦσαι Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχου-
σαι. The ancient commentators,

however, understood it to mean:
‘Come back to earth from the
council of the gods (in the pre—
ceding ode).' This is possible.
