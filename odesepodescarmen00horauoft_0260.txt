N otice that two points are brought
out in this strophe : Regulus' moral
courage in inducing the senate to
, accept his proposal, and the sels-
· sacrifice which this involved.

Note the contrast between t
earlier part of the ode and t
quiet close. The ode is one
Horace’s noblest; its natio ’
characteristics are well summ ,
up by Andrew Lang in his Leti
to Dead Anthors, p. 191 f. ⁴ No
but a patriot could have sung t
ode on Regulus, who died, as
hero died on an evil day, for t
honor of Rome, as Gordon ,⁴
the honor of England. . . . W
talk of the Greeks as your teae‘t
ers. Your teachers they wer·
but that poem could only hay
been written by a Roman. T
strength, the tenderuess, the no
and monumental resolution a ,τ
resignation—these are the gi ¹
of the lorch of human things,
masters of the world.'
