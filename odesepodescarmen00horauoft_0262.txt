9. iam bis, etc.: the Romans

in the east: that of Crassus at
Carrhae 53 13.C.; that of Decidius
Saxa by Pacorus in Syria 40 Bc. ι

and that of Antony in Media 36
Bc. As the defeat of Saxa was
avenged in 38 13.c. by Ventidius. χ
Horace may refer to the first and
third disasters only, but it is need-
less to demand historical accuracy
of a poet in every case. The only ,

sei-ted Antony. Ϊ
