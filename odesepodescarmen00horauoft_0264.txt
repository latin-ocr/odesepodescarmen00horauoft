Non his iuventus orta parentibus

z'.e. while still unmarried3 opposed
to mox v. 25.—de tenero . . . un-
gui: in imitation of the Greek
ἐξ ἁπαλῶν ὀνύχων, ‘from the very
quick.' Translate,—t0 lter very
finger lips. Cf. Anth. Pal. 5, 129,
1 ff. τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσίης ὀρχηστρί-
δα, τὴν κακοτέχνοις Ι σχήμασιν
ἐξ ἁπαλῶν κινυμένην ὀνύχων, Ι

from Asia, vibrating to her very
finger tips in her shameless danc-
ing figures, her I praise.'

25 ff. mox: τῖε. when married.
—iuniores: zle. than her husband.
- neque eligit ε presently she falls
so low that she can no longer
choose the recipients of her favors,
but must obey the orders of the
lowest peddler or ship captain.

trasts between neque eligit and

sents to his 'wife's adulteries.-— ῃ
institor: while the peddler be· ,
longed to a despised class his
trade naturally brought him into “
contact with the women of the μ
household. Cf. Seneca's warning, ”
Frg. 52 H. institores gemmarum ’
sericarumque vestium si intromi-
seris, periculum pudicitiae est.—
navis . . . magister: also belong-
ing to the lower classes, but like
the peddler able to spend money
freely (pretiosus emptor).

33 ff. non his: ‘theRomans who
made Rome great were sprung from
different stock.'—infecit aequor,
