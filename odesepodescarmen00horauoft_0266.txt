The unbroken serious strain of the national odes is relieved by these
light verses addressed to Asterie, whose lover is kept from home by
opposing winds. The names are Greek, but the Setting is Roman.

‘Why dost thou weep, Asterie, for thy lover, detained by winter '
winds across the sea ? Be assured that he is faithful, and ever turns a
deas ear to the messages of his love—lorn hostess‚ who would tempt
him to her. Fear not for him, but see that thou remain thyself as
true. Yield not to the chartus of thy handsome neighbor: do not listen

to his serenade.'
There is no indication of the date. Metre‚ 73.

primo restituent vere Favonii
