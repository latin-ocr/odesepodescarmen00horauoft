To Maecenas. ‘You are puzzled then, my learned friend, over my
bachelor's sacrifice on the matrons' Calends. This is the day the tree
so nearly killed me3 as each year comes round, I'll celebrate the season
with a fresh jar of long-stored wine. So drink deep, Maecenas, sor thy
friend's escape. Let go the cares of state3 our border foes are all sub-
dued or vexed by their own quarrels. Become to-day a private citizen3
dismiss your serious thoughts, and take what joys the passing hour now

offers.'
