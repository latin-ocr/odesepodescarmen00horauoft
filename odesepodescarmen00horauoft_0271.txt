The Reconciliation. Lydia and her lover have fallen out, but are now
«gmdy to return to their former love. The ode dramatically tells the story.
jn the first·strophe the lover's reproaches show his regret and hint that
‘she is willing to be reconciled3 Lydia answers in similar fashion, but
[without helping him on. Then each defiantly boasts of a new sweet-
Ilteart3 but in the last two strophes the lover yields, and proposes a
ilemnciliatiom to which Lydia joyfully agrees.
Ι This exquisite ode is the only one of Horace’s lyrics in dialogue.
