daughters of Danaus, who, compelled to marry their cousins, Aegyptus’
fifty sons, were forced by their father to promise to kill their husbands
on their wedding night, —a crime for which they suffered eternal pun—
ishment. They had a constant reminder of the myth m the statues of
Danaus and his daughters, which occupied the intercolumnary spaces
of the portico to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine. Cf. introductory
n. to 1, 31 ς Prop. 3, 29, 33 Ovid Trist. 3, 1, 61. The story is essentially
narrative, and proper for epic treatment, but Horace wisely selected for
his lyric form a single part of the myth-the story of Lycneus and Hy·
permestra, and from this chose the dramatic moment when Hyper-m
mestra rouses her husband and bids him fiee for his life. The sames
good taste is shown in his treatment of the story of Europa 3, 27; but
both odes are in marked contrast to 1, 15. Ovid followed Horace in..
handling of the theme in his Heroides 14. The treatment there should}>
be carefully compared with this. Metre, 69.
