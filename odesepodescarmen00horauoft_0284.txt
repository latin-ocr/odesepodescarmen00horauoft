3, 14, 1]· HORATI

While the first three strophes are somewhat stiff and formal, there
can be no doubt that Horace's welcome was sincere and that the fourth

strophe gives the basis of the poet’s gratitude —the sense of security ⁷

and peace under Augustus' rule. The light verses of the last three
strophes simply expand eximet curas of v. 14 and show Horace's light-
heartedness. Metre, 69.
