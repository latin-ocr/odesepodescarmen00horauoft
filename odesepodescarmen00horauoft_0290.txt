HORATI

reges muneribus; munera navium ¹

saevos inlaqueant duces.
Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam ιι
maiorumque fames; iure perhorrui
late conspicuum tollere verticem,
20 Maecenas, equitum decus.

‘ Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,

- ab dis plura feret.

Nil cupientium

nudus castra peto et transfuga divituml
partis linquere gestio, Χ

15 f. muneribus3 munera: with
brim,- yes, bribes, l say. lntr. 28 b.
—navium duces: some see here a
reference to Menas (or Mene-
doms), the freedman of Cn. Pom-
pey and admiral of Sextus Pom-
pey, who in 38 13.c. deserted to
Octavianus; afterwards he re-
turned to his earlier allegiance,
only to desert agaim—saevos:
stern though tlzey be. —inlaqueant :
ensnare.

17 f. crescentem, etc.: a com-
mon sentiment. Cf. Theoc. 16,
64 f. ἀνήριθμος δέ οἱ εἴη ἄργυρος,
αἰεὶ δὲ πλεόνων ἔχοι ἵμερος αὐτόν,
‘His be unnumbered wealth, but
may a longing for more ever pos-
sess him.' Iuv. 14, 139 crescit
amor nummi, quantum z'p5a pe-
cunia crevit. — fames: cf. Epist.
1, 18, 23 argenti sitis importuna
famesque3 Verg. A. 3, 57 auri
sacra fames.

19 f. late conspicuum: prolep-
tic, so that it could be seen afar.
—equitum decus: Maecenas was

a good example of the moderation
Horace is urging: although p'os-

sessed of great wealth and infiu- ⁷

enee, he modestly declined political
preferment. Cf. n. to 1, 1, ι ; 20, 5.

21 f. plura, . . . plura : the
context in this paradox shows the
meaning. By the first plura Hor-

ace means money and the unes· .

sential things which it procures,

V‘this world's goods'; by the sec-

ond, the real goods which cannot
be bought, but are gifts from '3

heaven,—a contented mind and
ability to find happiness in simple
things.—nil cupientium: and so
content. Cf. Maximian. 1, 54 et
rerum dominus nil cupiendo sui.
23 f. nudus: i.e. leaving all en-
cumbrances of wealth and luxury.
—transfuga : continuing the figure

of the soldier eager to leave the ³·“2

party (partis) to which he now
belongs, and flee to the opposite
camp. —divituuu and therefore
discontent‚ contrasted with nfl
cupientium.
