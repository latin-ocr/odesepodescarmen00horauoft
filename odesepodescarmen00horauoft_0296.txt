3· 19, 1] HORATI

19

‘ You prate of ancient genealogies and wars‚ but never a word do you
say on the real questions of the moment—how much we shall pay for a
jar of wine, how, where, and when we shall drink. Come, a toastlto
the Moon, to the Night‚ to oui friend Murena, the augur. The wine
shall be mixed as your tastes demand3 give music, scatter flowers, and
let old Lycus hear our din and envy our light loves)

Horace thus dramatically portrays a company whic'h has fallen into
serious conversation on mythological subjects‚ and forgotten the pur-
pose of the gathering. In the first two strophes he recalls his compan?
ions from their soberer talk3 then suddenly assuming the character of
magester bibendi, he names the toasts, the strength of the wine that ⁷
shall be used, and calls for flowers and music. The occasion for the ·
ode may have been a symposium in Murena's honor (v. 10 f.), but it is
. more likely that the poet's imagination gave the impulse for the lines. —-
They should be compared with C. 1, 27. The date of composition&
cannot be determined. Metre, 71. 4
