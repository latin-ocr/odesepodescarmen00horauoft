ἈΙ 'm ἐ

An address to a jar of wine, which Horace will broach in honor of j
his friend Corvinus. ·:

Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus was a student in Athens with‘:
Horace, and like him served in Brutus⁷ army in 42 B-C.‘; later he took ’,
part in the struggle against Antony. He was consul in 31 B.c., and in ,ἕ
27 B.c. 'enjoyed a triumph over the Aquitanians. After this he devoted
himself to the practice of law and the pursuit and patronage of litera-'
ture. His eloquence is praised by Cicero (ad Brut. 1, 15, 1); Quin—
tilian (10. ῐ, 113) compared his oratory with that of Asinus Pollio„
Messala's great wealth and high social position made it possible for him ’
to gather about him a literary circle second only to that of Maecenas.
Tibullus was the most distinguished of this company, and has lest many
references in his verses to his patron.

The ode is dramatically conceived: the poet stands before the jars]
stored in his apotheca and bids one contemporary with himself cornea}
down and yield up its store. whether it contain sport or contendun- 2³
As the gossip os tradition credits Messala with being a connoisseur of·
wines, vv. 7—10 possibly refer to his ability. The date of composition}
