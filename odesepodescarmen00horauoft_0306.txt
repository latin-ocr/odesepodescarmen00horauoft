other special festivals honor was
paid to the Lares. So Cato deAgr.
143 directs (vilica) kalendis idz'bus
nonis, festus dies cum erit, coro-
nam in focum indat, per eosdemque
dies Lari familiari pro copia sup-
plicet. — marino rore ε the aromatic
rosemary used by those who could
not afford the costly imported in-
cense. — fragili: brittle.

17 f. immunis: here innocent.
gm'ltless; elsewhere in Horace it
means ‘without bringing a gift‚’
4, 12, 233 lzpist. 1, 14, 33. In
this passage, however, the point
which Horace wishes to empha-
size is the acceptability of inno—
cence over great offerings, so that
ilnmum's is used absolutely in the
sense of immunis sceleris. The
idea is commonplace. Cf. Eurip.
Frg. 327 ἐγὼ δὲ πολλάκις σοφωτέ-
ρους Ι πένητας ἅνδρας εἰσορῶ τῶν
πλουσίων, Ι καὶ <τοὺς> θεοῖσι μικρὰ
θύοντας τέλη Ι τῶν βουθυτούντων
ὄντας εὐσεβεστέρους. ‘ I ofttimes
see poor men are wiser than
the rich, and they who make small
offerings to the gods more pious

than men who sacrifice great vic-
tims ς ’ also Frg. 946 εὖ ἴσθ’, ὅταν
τις εὐσεβῶν θύῃ θεοῖς, Ι κᾶν μικρὰ
θύῃ, τυγχάνει σωτηρίας. ‘ Be sure
that when a pious man makes
offering to the gods, even though
his offering be small, he gains
their saving aid.'

—non sumptuosa, etc. ε the ι
verse somewhat awkwardly adds a
new idea to the preceding state· :2'
ment— (thy hand) not made tlte ’
more persuasive by any costly vic-
tim.

19 f. mollivit: the gnomic per· ⁴
fect in conclusion—it has (and ⁶
always will), ete—aversos: not
‘hostile,' but disinclined, z’ndg‘ff‘er-' Ι
ent‚· cf. Epod. 10, 18.—-Penatis: ,ξ
not distinguished from the Lares.
—farre pio, etc.: a circumlocu- .
tion for the mola salsa, the sacri- ’
ficial cake, made of spelt and salt. ἒξ
The phrase is used by Tibullus 3.
4, 10 farre pio placant et saliente ἓ
sale: also by Ovid Fast. 4, 409 f. “·
sarra deae micaeque licet salientis
honorem detzlv. - saliente: τῖε.
when the salt was thrown on the fire. ·
