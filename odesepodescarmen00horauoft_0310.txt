HORATI

30 clarus post genitis, —quatenus‚ heu nefas!
virtutem incolumem odimus,
sublatam ex ocu'lis quaerimus invidi.
Quid tristes querimoniae,
si non supplicio culpa reciditur,
35 quid leges sine moribus
vanae proficiunt, si neque fervidis
pars inclusa caloribus

3011. post genitis: found only
here. — quatenus: since, introduc-
ing an explanation of the preced-
ing words. The sentiment is a
commonplace. Cf. Menander (ἒ)
δεινοὶ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ πάντες ἐσμὲν εὗ-
κλεεῖ ζῶντι φθονῆσαι, κατθανόντα
δ’ αἰνέσαι, ‘For we all are quick
to envy the man of good repute
while he is alive, but when he is
dead to praise him? Horace him-
self has developed the thought
Epist. 2, 1, 10 ff., 26 ff. Modern
poets too have many echoes of the
strain. Herriek declares with
mock resignation, ‘I make no
haste to have my numbers read: Ι
Seldome comes Glorie till a man
be dead.’ Pope's line also is fa-
miliar, ⁶ These suns of glory please
not till they set.⁷

—- incolumem: in tlte living. —
quaerimus: ποθοῦμεν, long far,
miss. As soon as one generation
is dead, its virtues are extolled by
the surviving to disparage the
generation that succeeds.

33 f. quid. etc.: z'.e. ‘to bring
about a genuine reform we must
cut at the root of the civic corrup-

tion; mere dismal (tristes) com—
plainings are of no avail without
bold action.'—reciditur: a meta-
phor taken from pruning; cf. S. 1, 3,
122 et magnis parva mineris (de
licta) Ι falce recisurum similz te.

35 f. The inefficiency of laws
unless supported by public senti-⁷ .
ment and character (mores) 1s rec-
ognised by Aristotle Pol. 2, 5, 14
ὃ . . . νόμος ἰσχὺν οὐδεμίαν ἔχει’
πρὸς τὸ πειθεσθαι παρὰ τὸ ἔθος, ,ε’
and present day conditions ευρ-Ξ
ply many examples. Some years&
later Horace extolled Augustus&
reign with the words mos et le&
maculosum edomuit nefas (4, 5, ff
22); Tacitus glorifies his Gennans ’
plus ibt bom mores valent quan
alibz bonae leges (Germ. 19). ⁷

36ff. si neque, etc.: the spe-
cial cases to illustrate the gene ’
truth contained in the precedin
question: ‘if the greed for gai
has grown so great that men da l
everything save the crowning dis-² ε
grace of poverty, what can merwi
statutes do. ²³ Cf. Petron. 143
quidfaciant leges, ubi sola pecun “

regnat?—pars: cf. 3, 3, 59ῆὲ
