Dicam insigne, recens, adhuc

indictum ore alio.

Non secus in iugis

exsomnis stupet Euhias,

lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
ripas et vacuum nemus

et consilio Iovis: the deification
of Augustus was early accomplished
by the poets of his court. Cf.
Verg. G. 1, 24 f. tuque adeo, quem
mox quae sunt habitura deorum Ι
concilia, incertum est. Also intro-
ductory n. to 1, 2, p. 56f.

n. The context makes it unneces-
sary to supply the obvious carmen.
Cf. n. to 1, 6, 5.

8 f. non secuS, etc. : the poet is
possessed by the divine influence
as fully as ever Maenad, who in
her ecstasy has wandered una-
wares far from her horne to some
height where, suddenly coming to
herself, she sees before her the
valley of the Hebrus and Rhodope
beyond. — exsomnis : the revels of
the bacchantes were carried on by

13· ripas: used absolutely as 4

3, 1, 23. -vacuumz the sacred

had overlooked their orgies and
then 1n their frenzy tore him limb-

from limb. —vertere· equivalent
