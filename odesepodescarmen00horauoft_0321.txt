Si quis infamem mihi nunc iuvencum

frangere enitar modo multum amati
cornua monstri.

O deorum

Antequam turpis macies decentis
occupet malas teneraeque sucus

moror: l keep death waiting.
(when l ought to seek him).

51 f. si quis: equivalent to
quisquis. Cf. 3, 24, 25 and n. -
inter: Intr. 32.—nuda: defense-
less.

52 ff. With the ancient con-
cept of life after death as acontinu-
ation of the present, it was natural
to believe that in the other world
the body appeared in the same
form in which it left this. The
cases of Dido and Deiphobus, A.
6. 450 and 494, are familiar illus-
trations. Also Stat. Silv. 2, 1,
154 ff. says of the death of a fav-
orite boy gratum est, fata, tamen.
quod non mors lenta iacentis Ι exe-
dit puerile decus manesque sub-
ivit 1 integer et nullo temeratus
corpora damno. It was natural
then that Europa should pray for
death before her beauty had faded.

53 ff. decentis: comely‚· cf. 1,
4, 6.—sucus: cf. Ter. Eun. 318
of a girl, color verus, corpus soli-
