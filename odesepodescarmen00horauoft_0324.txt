HORATI

The festival which occasioned this ode was the Neptunalia, which
fell on July 23. The people celebrated it in open air festival, erecting
booths of boughs, called umbrae, along the banks os the Tiber or on the
seashooe, for protection from the sun. Horace, however, represents
himself as on his farm, where he bids his severe housekeeper J'oin him

in a carouse. Metre, 71.

Festo quid potius die

Neptuni faciam? Prome reconditum,
Lyde, strenua Caecubum,
munitaeque adhibe vim sapientiae.

5 Inclinare meridiem

sentis et, veluti stet volucris dies,
parcis deripere horreo
cessantem Bibuli consulis amphoram. Ξ

Nos cantabimus invicem

1 ff. It suddenly occurs to Hor-
ace that it is the day of N eptune's
festival, which furnishes him an
excuse for some relaxation. —
prome: cf. 1, 36, 11. — recondi-
tum: hoarded away in the back
of the apotheca,· cf. Epod. 9, 1
repostum Caecubum. —- strenua :
to be taken with prome, lzurry and
bremia—munitae . . . sapientiae:
your well fortified (and stern)
philosophy. Lyde is evidently not
*given to carouses, but Horace
begs her for once to do violence
to her strenuous principles. Some
critics have wished to believe that
Lyde—who probably lived only
in Horace's imagination—-was a
flute girl, yet music girls possessed
no munitam sapientiam to hinder a
carouse, and the whole wit of Hor-
ace's verses lies in the absurdity

ε
of this proposal to his severe and ξ
probably old housekeeper to join Ξ·
him in a drinking bout and song. , ᾇ
5 f. ‘It is already late and we ἑ
must hurry.'—inclinare meridiem: ῖς
a common belief was that the sun ἦ
and stars were fixed in the vaulted
sky, which revolved, carrying thern
with it. Cf. Cic. Tusc. 3, ,3, 7 in-
clinato iam in postmeridianum ’,
tempus die. — et: andyet. — stet: ’
were standing still.
7 f. deripere: to hurry down.
Cf. 3. 21, 7, descende and n. With
the infin., cf. Epist. ι, 3, 16 ut
tangere vitet. ——- horreo: tle. the
apotheca. —cessantemz as if the
jar were reluctant.—Bibuli: M. Cal· ’
purnius Bibulus, consul in 59 B.c. ”

cf. 1, 6, 5 and n.—invicem: in .
my turn. — viridis: the tradi· ᾗ
