[3⁹ 29, 58

vel sole puro: non tamen inritum „K
quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque
diffinget infectumque reddet
quod fugiens semel hora vexit.’

Fortuna, saevo laeta negotio et
ludum insolentem ludere pertinax,
transmutat incertos honores, '

nunc mihi, nunc alii benignat

Laudo manentem : si celeris quatit
pennas, resigno quae dedit et mea
virtute me involvo probamque

pauperiem sine dote quaero.

Non est meum, si mugiat Africis
malus procellis, ad miseras preces
