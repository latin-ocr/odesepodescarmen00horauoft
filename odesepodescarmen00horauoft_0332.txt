In the prologue to the three books of odes Horace expresses thes}
modest hope that Maecenas will count him a lyric poet3 in the epi«
logne he triumphantly declares that he has built a monument of versef
that will outlast bronze and unnumbered time itself. He boasts that γ
his fame shall grow when heis dead, and that so long as Rome sh
last, men shall say that he was the first to transplant Aeolian verse to}⁴
Italy. So let the Muse place the laurel crown upon his brow-

It is little wonder that when Horace surveyed the substantia} bod&³ ·
of lyric verse which he was about to intrust to the world, he felt a natjg'.
ural pride in his accomplishment. This feeling was undoubtedly
creased by the thought of his humble origin and by the memory of h'ses'
early struggles for recognition and of the envious scorn he had arouse¹
among the noble poetasters of his day. Of this last, however, there '2 '
no hint in this ode. Horace now knew that his fame was secure. .
was the first Roman to write a large amount of lyric poetry, and 11⁹⁷* ἶ
odes had already received the favorable judgment of the best critics ’ l}
Rome. If to our modern taste he seems too frankin expression‚w
must remember that antiquity apparently took no such offense, for
had many predecessom, and later poets did not hesitate to speak wit
equa] boldness. Metre. only 1. 1 and here, 53.
