55 ff. The detailed description
of the young bullock furnishes the
ode with a quiet idyllic ending
similar to that in 3, 5, 53—56. At
the same time it emphasizes the
contrast between the wealthy An-

head of cattle off hand, and the
simple Horace who loves to linger
on the charms of his single victim.

thine‚ sweet Muse (13-24).'

The publication of his three books of odes in 23 13.c. had established
