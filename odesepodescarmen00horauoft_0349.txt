ticis. — quibus : the relative ; trans-
late, their. The indirect question
is introduced by unde. The refer-

and some have wished to regard
the verses as the invention of a
later writer. It is more probable
that Horace's usual good taste
deserted him. The passage may
be an attempt to imitate a Pin-

must remember that the ode was
made to order, and that such a
task was not inspiring to Horace's
muse.

19 f. deductus: the participle,
as frequently, contains the main
idea. — per omne tempus: zle.
