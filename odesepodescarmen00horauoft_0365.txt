the first two at least applied to
Torquatus, for he was a member
of the noble Manlian gens and
was an advocate of some eminence.
Note the eadence* of the verse.

25 ff. Two mythological illus-
trations. Observe that pudicum
and caro are set over against each
other, and express the qualities
for which Hippolytus and Piri-
thous were famous-the first for
his chastity in refusing the ad-
vances of Phaedra, his step-mother.
the second for his friendship with
Theseus. Horace follows the
Greek legend according to which
Artemis could not save her devo-
tee from death3 but the myth
among the Romans made Diana
restore Hippolytus to life and trans—
fer him under the name of Virbius
to her grove by Lake Nemi (Verg.
A. 7, 768 ff. ς Ovid. Met. 15,

548 ff.). —Pirithooz cf. n. to 3,4, 80.
