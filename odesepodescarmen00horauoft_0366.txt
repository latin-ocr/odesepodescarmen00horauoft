4, 8, 1] HORATI

8

The two following odes treat a single theme—the immortality of song.

⁵ Bronzes, marbles‚ pictures I have none to give, good friend Censo-
rinus, nor wouldst thou desire them. Song is thy delight‚ and song 1
can bestow. The chiseled record of men's deeds is weaker than the
Muse. Through her gift the great ones of the past escaped oblivion,
and have their place in heaven)

C. Marcius Censorinus, cos. 8 B.c., is known only from these versa
and a single reference in Velleius. 1t has been conjectured not witho ⁷
reason that this ode was Horace's gift to his friend on the Calends (1ιῖ
March or on the Saturnalia, when presents were exchanged as at σιιξ,
Christmas. Metre, 53.
