4, 9, 1] HORATI

The M. Lollius addressed was consul 21 B.C.; in 16 B.c. he wal
defeated by the Sygambri while governor of Belgian Gaul. In 2 Bc}
he was appointed governor of Syria and adviser and tutor of the youn}
Gaius Caesar, who was then on a mission to Armenia. He died sudss
denly, gossip said by suicide, in the following year.¹ Horace's ode wagv
probably written soon after Lollius⁷ defeat in 16 13.c., as an apology for
his friend. Strangely enough the very virtues attributed to him here
*honesty and rectitude —are the ones denied him by Velleius (2, 975
cf. Plin. N. H. 9, 58), who charges him with avarice and venality in
the East. Which account is nearer the truth we cannot determineff
