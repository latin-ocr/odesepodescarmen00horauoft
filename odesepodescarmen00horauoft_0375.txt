CARMINA

[4‚ 11

O crudelis adhuc et Veneris muneribus potens,
insperata tuae cum veniet pluma superbiae
et quae nunc umeris involitant deciderint comae,
nunc etqui color est puniceae flore prior rosae

5 mutatus, Ligurine, in faciem verterit hispidam,
dices ‘ Heu‚' quotiens te speculo videris alterurn,
‘ quae mens est hodie, cur eadem non puero fuit,
vel cur his animis incolumes non redeunt genae ?'

1 ff. Cf. Theoc. 23, 33 f. ἥξει
καιρὸς ἐκεῖνος, ὁπανίκα καὶ τὺ φιλά-
σεις, 1 ἁνίκα τὰν κραδίαν ὀπτεύ-
μενος ἁλμυρὰ κλαύσεις.- Veneris
muneribus: cf. ll. 3, 54 f. οὐκ ἄν
τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις τά τε δῶρ’
Ἀφροδίτης, 1 ἦ τε κόμη τό τε εἶδος,
· ὅτ’ ἐν κονίῃσι μιγείης. - insperata:

11, 77 ἢν δ’ ἐθέλῃς τὸ πρόσωπον
ἰδεῖν ἐς ἐσόπτρον ἑαυτοῦ Ι ιοὐκ
εἰμὶ Στρατοφῶν,’ αὐτὸς ἐρεῖς ὀμό-
σας. ‘But if thou wilt look at
thy face in the mirror, thou wilt
say on thy oath, ··1 am not Stra-
tophon.''’

11‘

An invitation to Phyllis to j0in in celebrating the birthday of Mae-

’ cenas.

‘Come‚ Phyllis, here is ple-rsty. and my house is all abustle with our
preparations (1-12). We must keep the birthday of Maecenas, dearer
to me almost than my own (13—20). Telephus is not for thee, but for
a maid of richer station. Remember it was ambition that brought low

’ Phaethon and Bellerophon. Come then, last of my flames, and learn a

song to lessen thy love cares (21—36).'

ln theme and treatment this ode is not unlike 3, 28. It is interest-
’ ing to note that it contains the only reference to Maecenas in this book.
which is so largely devoted to the praise of Augustus and his stepsons:

.> but the warmth of vv. 17—20 shows that no shadow had fallen on the

friendship between Horace and his patron. The year of composition is
unknown. Metre, 69.
