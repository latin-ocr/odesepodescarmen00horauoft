’ ξ ’ CARMINA

{drink a cup of choice wine at my house, bring a box of precious nard
g‚2with thee. Let go thy cares and give thyself up to our revel (13-28) .'

J This is the third of Horace’s poems on this theme3 but whereas in
, the others (1, 4 and 4, 7) he employs the changes of the year to
remind us of the fleeting character of life, here he gives the matter a
more cheerful turn with only a glance (v. 26) at the gloomy world
below. The invitation is not unlike that of Catullus (C. 13) to his
friend Fabullus to dine with him and provide all the entertainment save
the unguent only.

The Vergil addressed cannot be the poet, who died in 19 B.c. ς but
we know nothing more of him than the ode tells us. Some critics
think that the similarity of v. 21 to v. 13 f. of the preceding ode shows
that they were written at about the same time. Metre, 72.

5. Ityn: the son of Procne

and Tereus. The mother slew
her son and served him up at table
to his father to avenge the latter's
outrage of Philomela, Procne's sis-
ter. When Tereus discovered the
horrible deceit that had been prac-
ticed on him, he and the two
sisters were changed into birds;
Procne became a swallow, and
Philomela a nightingale, accord-
ing to the form of the myth which
Horace seems to follow here. The
swallow is the proverbial messen-
ger of spring with both Greeks
and Romans, so there seems little
doubt that this bird is meant by
infelix avis. — flebiliter ε piteonsly.
