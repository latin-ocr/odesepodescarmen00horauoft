HORATI

aeternum opprobrium, quod male barbaras
regum est ulta libidines.

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium
10 custodes ovium carmina fistula
delectantque deum cui pecus et nigri
colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, Vergili;
sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum
15 si gestis, iuvenum nobilium cliens,
nardo vina merebere.

Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum,

qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis,

spes donare novas largus amaraque
20 curarum eluere efficax.
