HORAT 1

doctae psallere Chiae
pulchris excubat in genis;

importunus enim transvolat aridas
10 quercus et refugit te quia luridi
dentes, te quia rugae
turpant et capitis nives;

nec Coae referunt iam tibi purpurae
nec cari lapides tempora quae semel

ι 5 notis condita fastis

inclusit volucris dies.

Quo fugit venus, heu, quove color, decens

quo motus ?

οὗ δ’ ἂν εὐανθές τε καὶ εὐῶδες ᾗ,
ἐνταῦθα καὶ ἐνιζάνει καὶ μένει.
·Love is not wont to rest upon
a form from which the flower
of beauty has already fled3 but
where fair bloom and fragrance
sweet exist, there he lights and
ever stays.'-Chiae: this name
is found on inscriptions of freed-
women. — excubat: keeps vigil
οη.

9 ff. importunus: rude, rulle-
lcss.—aridas: in contrast with
virentis v. 6. Cf. also n. on sucus

fugit and turpant, as the repeated
te makes clear. — capitis nives: if
this metaphor was not invented
by Horace, it certainly is not much
older. Quintilian 8, 6, 17 con-
