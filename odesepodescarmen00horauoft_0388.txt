HORATI

te caede gaudentes Sygambri
compositis venerantur armis.

suadere, non interire animas, . . .
atque hoc maxime ad virtutem exci-
tare putant, metu mortis neglecto.

51· Sygambri: the list closes
with a people lately subdued. See
1ntr. n. to 4, 2.

' The closing ode of the book is appropriately given to the praise of
Augustus alone. It stands in the same close relation to 14 that 5 does
to 4. (See the introductions to these odes.)

‘When I would sing the deeds of war, Apollo checked my course,
My song shall rather be of thy age, Caesar, which has brough't back
peace and its blessings‚ and recalled the ancient virtues which built our
empire from the rising to the setting sun (1-16). So long as Caesa}
guards our state, no fear of civil strife or foreign foe shall vex our peace
(17-24). And every day over our wine, with wives and children byg
we'll pray the gods in forms prescribed, and hymn the great ones of out
past, kindly Venus* line (2 5—32).'

It should be noted that this ode like 5 extols Augustus as the.
restorer of peace and morality, while 4 and 14 glorify his success in
war. In date of composition it is probably the latest of a113 the fac't
that no mention is made of Augustus' return to Rome on July 4, 13 Βάκ,
οι· of the honors planned for his return, makes it very probable that it
was written before that date, approximately toward the end of 14 13.C.>
