CARMEN SAECVLARE

 

Horace's pree‘minent art was officially recognized in 17 B.C. by his
appointment to write the hymn for the celebration of the ludi saecu-
lares. This festival originated in a worship of the gods of the lower
world by the gens Valeria at a spot in the Campus Martius called
Terentum (or Tarentum), near the bend in the river not far below the
present Ponte San Angelo. In 249 B.C.‚ after the defeat at Drepanum,
some searful portents prompted a consultation of the Sibylline Books:
these ordered a celebration of the ludi Tarentini, and further directed

that the festival should be repeated every hundred years. Thus the gen- ’

tile cult became a national one. The second celebration was not in 149
but 146 13.c.; the confusion of 49 B.c. must have prevented any thought

of the ludi in that year. Apparently Augustus thought of a similar ν

festival in honor of Apollo and Diana for 23 B..C 3this undoubtedly
would have taken the form of an appeal to these divinities to avert the
misfortune which then threatened the state and the emperor— the bad
harvest with its attendant hardship and Augustus⁷ sickness (cf. Intr.
n. to 1, 21 and n. to Ι, 21, 6). For some unknown reason the celebra-
tion was deferred. The year 17, however, marked the close of the
decade for which Augustus in January‚ 27 B.c.‚ had undertaken the

direction of the state. In this ten years the Roman world had revived

under the blessings of peace and had seemed to enter on qnew era.
Augustus proposed to celebrate the close of this period by a revival
of the ludi saeculares in new and magnificent form.

To obtain religious sanction for his plan he applied to the quinde-
cimviri, the college in charge of the Sibylline Books‚ who took 110
years as the length of the saeculum,— antiquarians differed as to whether
100 or 110 years was the correct number‚—and on this basis pointed
to four previous dates for celebrations beginning with 456 B.C.; the
