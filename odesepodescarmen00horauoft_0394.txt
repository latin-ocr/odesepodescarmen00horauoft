HORATI

(C. S. 13 ff.) ς and on the third night a sow big with young was sacri-
ficed to Tellus (C. S. 29 ff.).1

After the sacrifice of the first night, scenic representations were

begun on a stage without seats for the audience, and continued uninter-
ruptedly throughout the festival 3 beginning with the first day, however,
they were given in a theater erected for the occasion (ludi Latini in
theatro lzgneo quod erat constz'tutmn in campo secundum Tiberim).

On the first day Augustus and Agrippa each sacrificed a white bull

to Jupiter on the Capitol, and the following day each a white cow to
Juno in the same place ; on the third day, when the festival reached its
climaX‚ Augustus and Agrippa offered consecrated cakes to Apollo and
Diana at the temple of Apollo on the Palatine (cf. introductory n. to 1,
31) 3 and then twenty-seven boys and a like number of girls, especially
chosen for this service, sang the hymn which Horace had written for the
occasion, and repeated it on the Capitol (sacrificioque perfecto pueri
XX Vll quibus denuntiatmn et puellae totidem carmen cecz'nerunt5 eodem-

que modo in [japitolio. Carmen composuit Q. Horatius Flaccus). ln
addition to these ceremonies 110 matrons conducted sellesterm'a to
Juno and Diana on each day3 and lude· circenses and ludi honorarii
were continued seven days (June 4-11) after the close of the festival.²

The ode itself lacks the grace and ease of most of Horace's lyric
verse3 its formal phrases when read seem stiff and rigid. Doubtless ’ ’

1 The verses of the oracle ordering these ceremonies are as follows:—

μεμνῆσθαι, Ῥωμαῖε, . . .

ῥέζειν ἐν πεδίῳ παρὰ θύβριδος ἄπλετον ὕδωρ,
ὅππῃ στεινότατον, νὺξ ἡνίκα γαῖαν ἐπέλθῃ,
ἠελίου κρύψαντας ἑὸν φάος· ἔνθα σὺ ῥέζειν
ἱερὰ παντογόνοις Μοίραις ἄρνας τε καὶ αἶγας
κυανέας, ἐπὶ ταῖς δ’ Εἰλειθυίας ἀρέσασθαι
παιδοτόκους θυέεσσιν, ὅπῃ θέμις· αὖθι δὲ Γαίῃ
πληθομένη χοίροις ὗς ὶρειὶοιτο μέλαινα,

2 The oracle prescribes these rites also in detail : —

πάνλευκοι ταῦροι δὲ Διὸς παρὰ βωμον ἀγέσθων
ἤματι μηδ’ ε’πὶ νυκτί· . .

.δαμιίλης δὲ βοος δέμας ἀγλαον Ἠρης
δεξάσθω νηὸς παρὰ σεῦ. καὶ Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,
ὅστε καὶ ἠέλιος κικλήσκεται, ἶσα δεδέχθω
θύματα Λητοΐδης. καὶ ἁειδόμενιιί τε Λατῖνοι
παιᾶνες κούροισι κόρῃσί τε νηὸν ἔχοιεν
ἀθανάτων. χωρὶς δὲ κόραι χορὸν αὑταὶ ἔχοιεν,
καὶ χωρὶς παίδων ἅρσην στάχυς, ἀλλὰ ’γονήων
πάντες ζωόντων, οἷς ἀμφιθαλὴς ἔτι φύτλη,
αἱ δὲ γάμου ζεύγλαισι δεδμημέναι ἤματι κείνῳ
γνὺξ Ἠρης παρὰ βωμὸν ἀοίδιμον ἑδριόωσαι
δαίμονα λισσέσθωσαν.
