EPODON LIBER

[1, 6

Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,
amice, propugnacula,

paratus omne Caesaris periculum
subire, Maecenas, tuo.

Quid nos, quibus te vita si superstite
iucunda, si eontra, gravis?

5 f. nos: i.e. J and such as l.
The plural of modesty, which Hor-
ace uses in his lyrics only here and
C. 1, 6,·5. 1732,17‚ 323 3, 28‚9.
While we employ a verb in trans—
lating, it is improbable that the
Romans were conscious of any
ellipsis in such phrases as this. —
si superstite, etc.: the apparent
use of si with the abl. abs. is
anomalous. te superstite alone
would form a protasis to vita . .
iucunda, and we should expect as
the alternative, te mortuo (vita)
gravis. To avoid the ominous te
mortuo, Horace euphemistically
says sz' contra, with which some
such verb as vivitur, or, as Por-
phyrio suggests, sit, is necessary;
this construction has its influence
on the preceding clause, so that
we must regard the entire relative
sentence as a condensed form for
quibus vita si te superstite (sit).
iucunda, si contra (sit), gravis.
The ellipsis is sornewhat similar to
that in v. 8 below, ni tecum simul
(persequemur), etc. — superstite:
superstes here means ‘living on,'
elsewhere in the epodes and odes
‘out-living,' ‘surviving another's
death.'
