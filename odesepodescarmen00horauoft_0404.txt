HORATI

utrumne iussi persequemur otium,
non dulce, ni tecum simul,
an hunc laborem, mente laturi decet
ιο qua ferre non mollis viros?
Feremus, et te vel per Alpium iuga
inhospitalem et Caucasum,
vel Occidentis usque ad ultimum sinum
forti sequemur pectore.
15 Roges tuum labore quid iuvem meo,
imbellis ac firmus parum?
Comes minore sum futurus in metu,
qui maior absentis habet,

7. utrumne: a combination of
two interrogatives introduced by
Horace, who uses it only here and
in S. 2, 3, 2513 6, 73. It is em-
ployed by Curtius, Pliny, and other
later prose writers.— iussi :‘ sc. a
te, at thy bzddz'ng. Horace's re-
quest to be allowed to accompany
Maecenas had already been re-
fused—persequemur otium: give
ourselves up to a [ἤι’ of ease.

8. ni tecum: cf. n. on v. 5.

9 f. laborem : in eontrast to otium
v. 7. By a slight zeugma con-
nected with persequemur, whereas
the more natural verb with it is
fero, which is used in the relative
clause immediately following. -
laturi: ready to bear. Intr. 110.

11 f. feremus: the position
and form show Horace's emphatic
resolve. — Alpium, caucasum : the
Alps and the Caucasus were stock
examples of hardships. —inhospi-
talem Caucasum: repeated C. 1, 22,

6 and adopted by Seneca, Thyest. ,
10 52 quis z'nlzospzlalzls· Caucasi ru-
pem asperam Heniochus habitans ,ἲ
For the position of et, see Intr.
31.

13. sinum: recess, expressing
the remoteness of the western sea. ⁷
Cf. Verg. G. 2, 122 India . . . ex- γ
tremi sinus orbis.

15· roges: equivalent to si
roges.—tuum . . . meo: parallel
in form to Caesaris periculum sub-
ire, Maecenas, tuo 3 f.

16. imbellis ac firmus parum: -

cf. the Homeric ἀπτόλεμος καὶ
ἄναλκις·
self for running away at Philippi
C. 2, 7,8ff.(1ntr. p. 11); the sec-
ond half of his description here
probably refers to his poor health.
—parum: cf. C. 1, 12, 59 and n.
to 1, 2, 27.

17 f. An appeal to Maecenas' ν
friendship‚ ⁴1 do not claim that Ι
can help you, but 1 beg you, save

400

Horace laughs at him· '-
