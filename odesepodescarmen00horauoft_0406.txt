29 f. The lofty ridge of Tuscu—
lum, on the northeast side of the
Alban Hills, about fifteen miles
from Rome, was a favorite resort
in antiquity, as it has been in mod-
ern times. The northern slope
was then as now occupied by vil-
las, Cicero, Julius Caesar, Lucul-
lus, and others possessed country
homes there. The buildings had
stucco, or possibly in some cases
marble‚ walls, whose gleam (villa
candens) could be seen from Rome,
as the present villas can to-day.

— Circaea moenia: so named
because tradition said that Tele-
gonus, the son of Circe by Ulysses,
founded Tusculum. So the town

is called C. 3, 29, 8 Telegoni iuga

Cf. Cic. pro Mil. 51 villam quae
viam tangeret.

31. satis superque: note the em-
phasis. With the sentiment, cf. C.

Chremes appears in our extant
plays, although the name is com-

tion as avarus Chremes. ’

‘ “ F ree from the busy rush of town, how fortunate is he who can till his
ancestral fields, care for his vines, his orchards, flocks, and bees (1—16).
His are the delights of autumn, summer, and winter (17—36). These ν
make one forget the pains of love (37-38); and if there be beside a
