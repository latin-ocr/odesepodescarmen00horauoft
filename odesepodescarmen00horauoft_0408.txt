HORATI

forumque vitat et superba civium
potentiorum limina.
Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
10 altas maritat populos,
aut in reducta valle mugientium
prospectat errantis greges,
inutilisve falce ramos amputans

feliciores inserit,

r 5 aut pressa puris mella condit amphoriS,
aut tondet infirmas ovis3

Claudian carm. min. 52, 7f. non
freta mercator tremuit, non clas-
sica miles,· Ι non rauci lites pertu-
lit ille sori. —superba . . . limina:
referring to the morning call, salu-
tatio, and the humiliations to which
clients were exposed from their
patrons. Imitated by Seneca,
Epist. 68, 10 pulsare superbas po-
tentiorum fores.

9. ergo: amiso, being free from
such cares. —adulta ε according
to Columella, when three years old.
In this word lurks the figurative
sense — ‘ old enough for marriage.'
—propaginez shoot, properly the
‘ layer ' by which new vines were ob-
tained. See Class. Dict. s.v. vitis.

ιο. maritat populos: the black
poplar was considered second only
to the elm as a support for grape
vines. The ‘wedding ' of the vine
and tree seems to have been a
sarmer's expression that established
itself early in literature3 so Cato
says R. R. 32 arbores facito ut
bene maritae sint. Milton adopts

the figure P. L. 5 ‘ or they led the
vine Ι To wed her elm3 she„
spoused, about him twines Ι Her
marriageable arms.' The plane
tree which has a thick foliage was
unfitted for this purpose, so C. >
2, 15, 4 platanus caelebs.

11 f. inreducta valle: repeated
C. 1, 17, 17. Connect with er- ⁷
rantis. -mugientium: used sub-
stantively like Vergil's balantum
gregem, G. 1, 272, for sheep.

13 f. ramos: of fruit trees.—
feliciores: more fruzfful. The
root appears in famina, sesscundas.
—inserit : grafts, a technical term.
Cf. insitiva, v. 19. ἑ

15 f. Note the aniteration.- j
pressa . . . mella: after as much ’
honey had drained out as naturally
would, the comb was pressed to
extract the remainder. Cf. Verg. ,
G. 4, 140 f. spumantia cogtre
pressis· mella savis. —infirmasz ff
weak, and so unresisting. A stock
epithet; cf. Ovid. lb. 44 pecus ⁷
in rmum.
