Horace was himself the son of a freedman, but nothing could be
more offensive to him than the straining and display of such parvenus.
His own attitude is clearly seen in S. 1, 6, where his calm tone shows
that he is discussing a general question. The fierceness of this epode
seems to warrant the belief that he has some definite individual in
mind, who probably was easily recognized by his contemporaries.
All efforts to identify him are useless. Many of the MSS. have ,
the inscription: ad Sextum Menam Lz'bertinum. Vedium Rufum
ex servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem dignitatem nsque ad tribu—
natum militum. The first part refers to Menas, or Menodorus, a
freedman of Sextus Pompey who twice deserted to Octavian. The
name Vedius was probably suggested to the earlier commentators by a
passage in Cicero's letter to Atticus (ad Att. 6, 1, 2 5) which was written
at Laodicea in 54 Bc, but not published until some time in the first

century A.D. lzoc ego ex P. Vedio, magno nebulone (rascal), sed Pompeii a

tamen familiari, audivi: ln‘c Vedius venit milti obviam cum duobus
essedis (English gzgs) et raeda (carryall) equis iuncta et lectica et
familia magna, pro qua, si C urio legem pertulerit, HS centenos pendat

nec deerant onagri (wild asses) .· numquam vidi hominem nequiorem. -

The possibility remains, however, that this epode is nothing more than .
an exercise after Archilochus (Intr. 4). The date of composition is ⁷

probably 36 ΒΕ. See n. to 17—19. Metre, 74.

sheep has been proverbial in liter-
ature from the Homeric poems
down. Cf. ll. 22, 262 ff. ὡς οὐκ

alent to sorte, lege naturae, i.e.
