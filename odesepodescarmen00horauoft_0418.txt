12. praeconis: the crier who
proclaimed the reason for the
punishment while the flogging was
going on. This particular upstart
has in his time been flogged so
often and so much that even the
praeco is sick and tired of it; and
yet to-day, arat Falerni mille fundi
iugera.

13. arat ε equivalent to possidet.
Cf. Verg. A. 3, 13 f. terraprocul
vastis colitur Alavortia campis Ι
Thraces arant. — Falerni : the
ager Falernus, in the south of
Campania, was famous for its vine—
yards. ——iugera ε the iugerum was
the Roman unit of measure for
land, containing about five-eighths
of an acre.

14. Appiam : sc. viam, the
great road leading to the south of
Rome, called by Statius longarum
regina viarum. This the parvenu
wears out (terit) as he drives‚ either
to exhibit his fine turnout to the
throng of travelers. who continu-
ally pass along the road, or to
visit his country estates. On this
use of tero, cf. Ovid. ex Ponto
2, 7, 44 nec magis -est curvis
A ppia trita rotis. —— mannis: Gallie

ponies, fashionable for pleasure
driving.

15 f. L. Roscius Otho, tribune
of the people, in 67 B.c. had a law
passed by which the knights were
assigned fourteen rows in the
theater back of the orchestra,
which belonged to the senators.
This upstart, regardless of his low
birth, takes his seat as knigffl,
swollen with pride (magnus) over.
his great wealth. Worse than
that, as tribunus militum he sits in
the first of the fourteen tows.
magnus is used in the same ironical
sense S. 1, 6, 72 magni quo pueri
magnis e centurionibus orti.

17—19. The allusions here give
us reason to believe that this epode
was written soon after the com-
pletion of the large ships referred
to. In 38 B.c. Octavian was
badly defeated by Sextus Pompey3
in the following winter 37-36 B.c.
he had a new fleet built, consisting
of very large and heavy vessels.
The date at which this epode was
composed is then probably 36 B.c.
