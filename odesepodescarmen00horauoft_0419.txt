The Romans were extremely superstitious, and during the last cen-

? ‘tm-y of the Republic especially, there was a rapid increase in the num—

ber of people among them who professed to practice the magic arts.

“»rhe efficacy of witchcraft and love potions was not doubted by the mass
³³, of the people. In this epode Horace pictures four hags, of whom Cani-

Ξ {fia is the chief, in the act of preparing one of their most potent charms

by which Canidia hopes to win back the affections of her aged lover.

s The quartette have captured a boy whom they propose to bury to the

chin in the atrium of Canidia's house, that he may starve. His death is
to be made the more painful by the sight of foocl frequently renewed,
that his longing for it may sink into his liver and very marrow, which
theu shall be used for the irresistible philter. It is not impossible that
children were occasionally murdered for such purposes3 at any rate
‘there was a current belief that such atrocities were practiced, as the

'¹ Chinese are said to believe to-day that the missionaries kill young chil-

dren to obtain the ingredients for certain charms. Cicero charges
Vatinius, in Vatin. 14 cum inaudita ac nefaria sacra susceperis, cum
inferorum animas elicere, cum puerorum extis deos manes mactare

⁴ soleas, etc. The following inscription, found in a columbarium on the
⁷ Esqniline, is also important testimony. CIL. 6, 19, 747 lucundus Liviae

Dran· Caesaris f(ilius) Grypln' et Vitalis. ln quartum surgens com-

² prensus deprimor annum, Ι cum possem matri dulcis et esse patri. Ι

Commentators have been much puzzled as to the identity of this

z Canidia, whom Horace mentions in two other ,epodes (3 and 17) and

in S. 1, 8. Porphyrio says that she was a certain Gratidia from Naples,
