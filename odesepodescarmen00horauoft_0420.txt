5, 1] HORATI

whose business was the manufacture of perfumes. There is also the
tradition that Horace was once in love with her, and that the celeres
iambi which he recants in the sixteenth ode of the first book, are
this epode and the seventeenth, a mock palinode. But Porphyrio‘s
identification is probably only a elever guess, based on verses 43 and
59, and Epode 17, 23, which give after all very insufficient basis for his
statement3 and the rest of the tradition has no foundation whatever.

It may be true that Horace attacked under the name Canidia some
unguentaria, well known at the time, who was ready to furnish potions
and poisons to her customers, but it is equally probable that Horace
had a purely literary motive in depicting a scene similar to that in Ver-
gil's eighth eclogue, the pharmaceutria, which is based on Theocritus'
second Idyll.

The epode is dramatically constructed. It opens with the eries and
prayers of the boy as he is hurried into the house (1—10). Canidia
orders the various materials for her infernal rites (ΙΙ-24), while Sagana

sprinkles the house with water from Avernus (25-28)3 Veia digs the κ

pit in which the boy is to be buried (29—40). A fourth hag, Folia, who
can call down the very moon and stars‚ is also present (41-46). Cani-
dia then prays that the charm she has already used may bring her aged
lover to her doors ς but suddenly the sear comes on her that some more
skillful rival may detain him (47—72). At this thought she breaks out
with the threat that she will use an irresistible charm (73-82). The
boy, seeing that his prayers are of no avan, calls down curses on his

murderesses and threatens that his shade shall haunt them (82-102).7

The date of composition cannot be exactly fixed, but is later than that
of S. 1, 8 and probably earlier than that of Epod. 17. Metre‚ 74.
