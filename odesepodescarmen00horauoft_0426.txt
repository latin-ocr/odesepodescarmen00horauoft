HORATI

nardo perunctum quale non perfectius
60 meae laborarint manus.
Quid accidit? Cur dira barbarae minus
venena Medeae valent,
quibus superbam fugit ulta paelicem,
magni Creontis filiam,
65 cum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam
incendio nuptam abstulit?
Atqui nec herba nec latens in asperis
radix fefellit me locis.
Indormit unctis omniurn cubilibus
70 oblivione paelicum.
A, a, solutus ambulat veneficae

67 ff. ⁴ Yet I made no mistake.
Still he must be sleeping over all

my magic unguents, forgetful of ⁹

every mistress) She has smeared

ment.

71 ff. A, a: suddenly the sear
strikes her that a elever rival may
have some more powersul chami,
and in fury she threatens Varus
with her irresistible philter. -solu-
tus: setfree‚· cf. C. 1, 27, 21.—
ambulat: walks abroad.

74. fleturum: doomed to weep,·
like the Greek κλαίω. Intr. 110.
——caput: in the sense of ⁴ person,⁷
