An attack on a scurrilous defamer, who like a cowardly cur dared to

assail only those who could not fight in return. ‘Attack me‚' says

“ , Horace, ‘and you will find I am ready to bite back. You bark nobly

= and then sniff the bone thrown to you (1—10). I shall prove a bull

, with horns as sharp as the iambi of Archilochus or Hipponax3 I arn no

boy to cry and not strike back (ιι-16)) The metaphors are only

, the dog.

ancients‚ whose religious ideas manner of the boy's horrible ,

ber of Mss. have the inscription in Cassium Severum, by which '

the early commentators probably meant the orator Cassius Severus,
banished by Augustus on account of his defamatory writings (Tac.
Dial. 193 Ann. 1, 273 4, 21). But this Cassius belonged to Ovid's

= generatim, so that he can hardly be the person meant. All other
guesses are equally futile. The verses may be only an exercise in iambi
(Intr. 4). Metre, 74.
