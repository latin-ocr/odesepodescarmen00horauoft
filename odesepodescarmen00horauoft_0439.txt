, - Α ⁴. . . driven by the wave, and in Salmydessus may the tufted Thracians
³ ⁷ give him kindest welcome, naked, stiffened with cold,—there shall he

suffer many woes to the full, eating the bread of slavery. And Ι pray
that he may have over him (for his covering) deep weed from the surge,
that his teeth may chatter as those of a dog that in its weakness lies on

'⁷ , its belly on the edge of the strand near the waves. This is what Ι could

 

wish to see (the man suffer) who has done me injustice and trampled
on his pledges‚ though he was once my friend.' Metre, 74.

Mala soluta navis exit alite,
ferens olentem Mevium:
ut horridis utrumque verberes latus,
Auster, memento, fluctibus;
5 niger rudentis Eurus inverso mari
fractosque remos differat;
insurgat Aquilo, quantus altis montibus
frangit trementis ilices,
nec sidus atra nocte amicum adpareat,
10 qua tristis Orion cadit,
quietiore nec feratur aequore

x f. mala . . . alite: modify- Thessopposite, C, 1, 7, 15, is albus

ing soluta. Cf. C. 1, 15, 5 mala
ducis avi domum. — olentem : rank,
for Horace will have it that he, like
Gargonius, S. 1, 2, 27, olet hircum.

3 f. All the winds of Heaven
unfavorable for a voyage to Greece
shall compass Mevius' ruin.—ut
verberes: optative subjunctive. ——
memento: parenthetical.

5. niger . . . Eurus: as it
gathers dark clouds. Cf. C. 1,
5, 6 aspera mgrris aequora ventis.

Notus and 3, 7, 1 candidus Favo-

1, 43 evertitque aequora ventis.

7. quantus: wille tlte power it
has when, ete—montibus: loca-
tive abl. Intr. 95.

9 f. amicum: predicate, witlz
kindly lzjgrht. — Orion, etc. ε Orion's
setting is accompanied with heavy
winds and storms. Cf. C. 1, 3,
14. Hence he, like the Hyades,
is tristis.
