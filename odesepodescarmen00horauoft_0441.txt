 

EPODON LIBER [ι 1, 7

libidinosus immolabitur caper
et agna Tempestatibus.

23 f. Horace mockingly closes
with the promise of a solemn
sacrifice of thanksgiving for the
storm that shall drown Mevius.
The libidinosus caper is clearly

chosen as a fit offering for relief
from an olens Mevius. With the
sacrifice of a lamb to the storms,
cf. Verg. A. 5, 772 Tempestatibus
agnam caedere deinde iubet.

II

Horace no longer finds any pleasure in writing verses, for love once
more has him in his meshes (1—4). · Two years have passed since he
freed himself from Inachia, who long charmed and tortured him (5—22) ς
now he is ensnared by the fair Lyciscus (23-28). The Pettius to whom
these verses are addressed is otherwise unknown to us. The names

Inachia and Lyciscus are borrowed from the Greek. Metre, 80.

Petti‚ nihil me sicut antea iuvat
scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
amore qui me praeter omnis expetit
mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
5 Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti
Inachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.
Heu me, per urbem (nam pudet tanti mali)

1 f. nihil: cognate object of
iuvat. — versiculos: the diminu-
tive in disparagement of the
epodic measure, unsuited for love
verses—amere: not fully per—
sonified.

3 f. amore: for the anaphora,
see Intr. 28 c.— praeter omnis:
the lover's inevitable extravagance.
⁴ No one ever suffered as he does!
—in puellis urere: cf. C. 1, 17,
19 f. dices laborantis in uno 1
Penelopen vitreamque Circen. For
the infinitive, see Intr. 107.

5 f. hic tertius December, etc. ε
tltis December which is stripping,
is tlte third since, etc. Horace
measures the years by the month
in which his birthday fell.—
Inachia furere: like the Greek
μαίνεσθαι ἐπί τινι. — honorem:
splendor. Cf. Verg. G. 2, 404
frzgidus et silvis aquilo decussit
honorem.

7 f. nam: in apology for his sigh,
heu me. Notice that the broken
order also expresses Horace's feel-
ing of shame.
