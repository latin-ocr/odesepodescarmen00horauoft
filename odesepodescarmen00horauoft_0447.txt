  

EPODON LIBER

[¹42 5

14

Α Maecenas had urged Horace again and again to finish up some col-

ffifion of verses, probably the book of epodes. Horace answers that
⁷ ’ ‚ ' cannot nOW, for he is in love, and even Anacreon could not write
'ffffinlished verses when smitten with Bathyllus. The poem closes with
‘the retort: ‘You too are in love, Maecenas, and should understand:

filiani< Heaven that your flame is not like mine.'

The colloquial and

familiar tone of the epode should be noticed. Metre, 75.

Mollis inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis

oblivionem sensibus,

pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
arente fauce traxerim,
„⁴5 candide Maecenas, occidis saepe rogando:

1-4. Maecenas' constant ques-
tion, given here in indirect form,
dependent on rogando, v. 5. —
mollis: the opening word gives
the keynote of the reproach.
Horace has grown ‘soft,' and has
forgotten all his promises—imis
. . . sensibus: dative, equivalent
to penitus. Cf. Verg. E. 3, 54
sensibus llaec imis reponas.

3. Lethaeos . . . somnos: the
sleep of complete forgetfulness.
Cf. Verg. A. 6, 714 f. Lethaei ad
fluminis undam Ι securos latices
et longa oblivia potant. —ut si:
not to be connected with tantam
only, but rather with imis . . .
sensibus, showing how completely
forgetfulness has taken possession
ofhim.-‹1ucentia: cf. C. 3, 1,
20 f. non avium citharaeque can-

· tus Ι somnum reducent, also Epist.

1, 2, 31 ad strepitum citharae ces-
santem ducere somnum.

4. traxerim: like the Greek
ἔλκειν; stronger than the ordi-
nary bibere or ducere, which is
used C. 1, 17, 21 pocula . . . duces
sub umbra. The latter word, how-
ever, would be impossible here, as
it has just been used in v. 3.

5. candide Maecenas: with gen-
eral reference to Maecenas' upright
character; here used because Hor-
ace recognizes the justice of his
patron's reproaches. Cf. 11, 11
candidum ingenium. In similar
fashion he addresses Tibullus
Epist. 1, 4, 1 Albi, nostrornm ser-
monum candide iudex. Cf. the
English ‘candid.'—occidis: col-
loquially extravagant. Cf. C. 2,
17, 13 also Plaut. Pseud. 93¹ oc-
cz'dzlr me, quom istuc rogas.
