for the state, which doubtless seemed to many to be sinking into ruin. · J
The difference between his feelings now and a few years later can be ⁸
seen from the words C. 1, 14, 17 f. nuper sollicitum quae (sc. naw's ⁷
= civitas) mz‘lzz‘ taedium, Ι nunc desiderium curaque non levis. Sellar
(p. 122) has aeutely observed that Horace seems to express the feelings
of the losing side before the peace of Brundisium3 Vergil, in his fourth
eclogue, those of the winning side after its conclusion. The poem is
not only the earliest, but the best of Horace's politica] verses. There
is an intensity of feeling and a patriotic enthusiasm that did not appear
later when the poet's anxieties had been calmed and somewhat blimted.

-In form also it is the most perfect of the epodes. Elision is wholly

avoided in the hexameters——a new effect in Latin verse-—and there e

are only three cases in the iambics. F urthermore there is a careful
regard for assonance and a skillful use os alliteration that combine with
other excellencies to make this one of the most remarkable productions
of the Latin poets. The epode has been a favorite with many.

The mention of the Fortunate Isles may be due to the belief that
Sertorius, after his defeat, wished to settle there. Cf. Plut. Sert. 9.
The Scholiast says on v. 42 ad quas (insulas fortunas) Sallustius in
lzz'stm‘ia dicit victum voluisse ire S ertarium. Probably the Canaries were
meant. It is not impossible that some of the party defeated at Philippi ,
had conceived the same plan. The thought running through the entire
epode is that the state is hopelessly distracted by internal strife3 it
cannot escape ruin. Therefore all who are earnest and strenuous should
settle in a new land where life can begin anew. The poem should be
compared with Epod. 7 and with Vergil's E. 4. Metre, 76.
