Vos, quibus est virtus, muliebrem tollite luctum,

Etrusca praeter et volate litora.

Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus; arva beata
petamuS, arva divites et insulas,

reddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quotannis
et imputata floret usque vinea,

germinat et numquam fallentis termes olivae

suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem,
mella cava manant ex ilice, montibus altis

39 f. vos: i.e. the melior pars.

' —virtus: manly courage, in con-

trast to muliebrem . . . luctum. —

Etrusca . . . litora: on the voyage

to the West. — et: for the position,

see Intr. 31.
4¹ f. nos, etc.: the decision is
now made, and the poet returns to
the glories of their new home in
the Fortunate Isles.—circumvagus :
apparently coined by Horace to
teproduce the Homeric ἇψόρροος,
the stream that circles around the
world. Ovid. Met. 1, 30 uses cir-
cumfluus for the same purpose.
Cf. Aesch. P. V. 138 ff. τοῦ περὶ
πᾶσάν θ’ εἱλισσομένου Ι χθόν’ ἀκοι-
μήτῳ ῥεύματι παῖδες πατρὸς Ὠκε-
ανσῦ. ‘Children of father Ocean,
who circles round the entire earth
with stream unwearied.' —- arva
. arva: Intr. 28 e.—divites
insulan: i.e. the Fortunate Isles in
theWestern sea; Homer's Elysian
Plain (Od. 4, 563 ff.). Hesiod's
islands of the Blest (οῤ. 170 ff),
where the heroes dwell. Cf. also
Tenn. ἄγεσθε, ‘ It may be that the
gulfs will wash us down: Ι It may

be we shalltouch the Happy Isles,
Ι And see the great Achilles, whom
we knew.' The ‘Fortunate Isles'
of later times are probably to be
identified with the Madeiras or the
Canaries, which were visited by
the traders. In this distant west·
ern land poets thought that nature
supplied all man's needs without
effort on his part.

43. reddit: i.e. as man's due.

45 f. numquam fallentis: cf. C .
3, Ι, 30 fundus mendax. This,
like imputata and inarata above,
emphasizes man‘s ease and confi-
dence there. -suamz emphatic.
The better varieties of figs can be
obtained only by grafting. Cf. 2,
19 insitiva pira and n. So Vergil
says of a grafted tree, G. 2, 82
miraturque novas frondes et non
sua poma. —pulla: ἵζε. ‘ripe'

47. mella: typica] ofabundance
like the Biblical ‘land flowing with
milk and honey.' Cf. C. 2, 19,
10-12, and Tibul. ι, 3, 45 f. zpsae
mella dabant quercus, ultroque fe-
rebant Ι obvia securis ubera lactis
oves. — montibus: Intr. 95.
