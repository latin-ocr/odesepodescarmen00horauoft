IIORATI

levis crepante lympha desilit pede.
Illic iniussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae,
50 refertque tenta grex amicus ubera,
nec vespertinus circum gemit ursus ovile,
neque intumescit alta viperis humus ;

61 nulla nocent pecori contagia, nullius astri
gregem aestuosa torret impotentia.
53 Pluraque felices mirabimur, ut neque largis

aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus,

48. The music of this verse has
been noted by commentators ever
since Porphyrio's day. Cf. C. 3,
13, 15 f. unde loquaces lymphae
desiliunt tuae. In this verse the
p-sound is added to that of the
liquid. This new home will also
have an abundant supply of water,
which is far more important in such
countries as Italy, especially in the
siticulosa Apulia, or in our Cali-
fornia‚ where there is a long dry
season, than in the middle and
eastern part of the United States.
—pedez carrying the figure in
desilit to its extreme. Anticipated
by Lucretius 5, 272 qua via secta
semel liquido pede detulit undas.

49 ff. The cattle need no herds-
man to bring them home, no pro-
tection against wild beasts. A
little later Vergil used the same
description to picture the golden
age that was approaching, E. 4,
21 f. ipsae lacte domum referent
distenta capellae Ι ubera. In Ver-
gil's verse ipsae is equivalent to
Horace⁹s iniussae, and distenta re-
places the simple teuta.

51· vespertinus: in effect an
adverb. Cf. Verg. G. 3, 537 f.

non lupus insidias explorat⁴ ovilia <
circum Ι nec gregibus nocturnus ,

obambulat. —circum gemit: Intr.

52. intumescit: the action of
the angry snake is transferred to ·
the ground. Cf. Intr. 99.——alta:
proleptic with intumescit, swells
and rises with.

δι f. These verses stand in all
the Mss. after v. 60, but are ob-
viously out of place3 by transfer-
ring them to this position the con-
tinuity of thought is maintained.
—nulla . . . nullius: Intr. 28 c.—
astri: especially such as Sirius: cf.
C. 3, 29, 17 ff. -aestuosa. . . impo—
tentia: the >dog-star's furious heat‚
which brings disease on the flocks
and herds. With this meaning of
impotentia, cf. impotens C. 1, 37,
103 3, 307 3·

53-56. ⁴ They shall be oppressed
neither by too abundant rains as
in the Italian winter, nor by too
great drought as in the Italian
summer. ⁹—ut2 how. -radatz ef.
