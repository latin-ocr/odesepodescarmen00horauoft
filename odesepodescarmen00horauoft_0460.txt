HORATI

Ι7

A mock palinode addressed to Canidia3 in pretended terror at the
sorceress' power Horace pleads for mercy. Yet in his very prayer (1—
52), as also in Canidia's reply (5 3-81)‚ he makes his sharpest attack by
rehearsing again all the charges he has ever made against her. Cf.
Epod. 5 and S. 1, 8. With the palinodie form, cf. C. 1, 16. The date
of composition naturally falls after these other two poems3 it cannot be

more accurately fixed. Me'tre‚ 58.

Iam iam efficaci do manus scientiae,

supplex et oro regna per Proserpinae,

per et Dianae non movenda numina,

per atque libros carminum valentium
5 refixa caelo devocare sidera,

Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris

citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

1. iam iam: cf. 2, 68, where the

to the tense of the verb. So Ca-
tullus says 63, 73 iam iam dolet

its end, and Horace is forced to

cording to Porphyrio, equivalent to
non lacessenda—not to be dis-
turbed witlz impunity, inviolable.

4 f. libros, etc.: books contain-
ing formulae for incantations and
magio. Cf. Acts 19, 19 ‘And not

a few of them that practiced curi- ’
ous arts brought their books to-
gether, and burned them in the
sight of all.'—valentium . . . de-
vocare: cf. v. 78 and n. to 5, 45.
—refixa: proleptic - unfix and,
as if the stars were fastened to the
vault os heaven. Cf. Verg. A. 5,
527 f. caelo ceu saepe refixa 1 trans-
currunt crinemque volantia sidera
ducunt.

6. parce: refrain from. Cf.
C. 3, 14, 12 male ominatis parcite

biguous, meaning both ‘holy' and
