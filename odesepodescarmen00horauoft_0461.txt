EPODON LIBER

[17³ 14

Movit nepotem Telephus Nereium,

in quem superbus ordinarat agmina

Ὶκ) Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat.
Unxere matres Iliae addictum feris

alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,
postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit

heu pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.

ἒ board which, when whirled at the
³ end of a string, made a whirring
γ noise, and was supposed to exer-

Ῑ eise a charm over the intended

γ victim. To loose the spell it was

ᾖ whirled in the opposite direction
’ (retro). It is still in use among

,Ι some uneivilized peoples.
ἕ. Andrew Lang‚ Custom and Myth,

See

p. 29ff. Cf. Thepoc. [α’. 2, 30 f.
χώς δινεῖθ’ ὅδε ῥόμβος ὁ χάλκεος,
·· ἐξ Ἀφροδίτας Ι ὣς κεῖνος δινοΐτο
’ ποθ’ ἅμετέρῃσι θύρῃσι. ‘And as
whirls this brazen wheel‚ so rest-
less, under Aphrodites spell, may
he turn and turn about my doors,
L'ucian‚ Dz'al. Meretr.
4, 5 describes its use.

8-18. Three mythical examples
of the effect of supplication. Tele-
phus, King of the Mysians, was
wounded by Achilles when the
Greeks landed at Troy. His
wound would not heal‚ and he was
finally forced to come as a suppliant
to his enemy, in accordance with
an oracle which said he could be
cured only by the rust of the spear
that had struck him. Aged Pri-
am's prayers made Achilles relent
and give back Hector's body. Circe

allowed Odysseus' compauions to
regain their human form.——ne-
potem . . . Nereium : Achilles'
mother Thetis was the daughter of
Nereus.

11. unxere: z'.e. prepared for
burial Hector's body. —addictum ε
τῖε. destined to be tlte fooa' os,
etc.‚ as a consolation to Patroclus'
shade. Cf. ll. 23, 179 ff. χαΐρέμοι,
ὦ Πάτροκλε, καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισι·
πάντα γὰρ ἤδη τοι τελέω, τὰ πάροι·
θεν ὑπέστην. Ι δώδεκα μὲν Τρώων
μεγαθύμων υἱέας ἐσθλοὺς Ι τοὺς
ἅμα σοὶ πάντας πῦρ ἐσθίει · Ἕκτορα
δ’ οὗ τι Ι δώσω Πριαμίδην πυρὶ
δαπτέμεν, ἀλλὰ κύνεσσιν.

12. homicidam : reproducing
the Homeric Ἕκτωρ ἀνδροφόνος.

13 f. rex: Priam. For the Ro-
mans the pathos of the situation
lay not in Priam's loss of his son,
but in the fact that this mighty
king was forced to humiliate him-
self and weep for his son before
Achilles. Cf. ll. 24, 509f. ὁ μὲν
Ἕκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο Ι κλαῖ’ ἇδινά’
προπάροιθε ποδῶν Αχιλῆος ἐλυ-
σθείς. Itis said this passage moved
Macaulay to tears. - pervicacis:
obstinate, but yielding in the end.
