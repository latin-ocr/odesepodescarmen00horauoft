HORATI

15 Saetosa duris exuere pellibus
laboriosi remiges Ulixei
volente Circa membra; tunc mens et sonus
relapsus atque notus in voltus honor.
Dedi satis superque poenarum tibi,

20 amata nautis multum et institoribus.
Fugit iuventas et verecundus color,
reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida,
tuis capillus albus est odoribus;
nullum a labore me reclinat otium,

²5 urget diem nox et dies noctem, neque est

¹5 f. The example of Circe is
well chosen. The poet prays that
Canidia like the early sorceress
will reverse her spell. —saetosaz
i-e. with swinish bristles.—duris
pellibus ε abl. with exuere. -labori-
osi: Homeric πολύτλας, πολυτλή-
μων; best taken with Ulixei. still,
cf. 16, 60.

17 f. mens: Horace supposes
that Circe's victims lost their minds
as well as shapes, but in the Ho-
meric account their fate is made
the more pathetic because their
wits remain. — sonus : voice.—
honor : in contrast to the ugly
swinish faces they had just put off.

20. amata, etc.: in this ironi-
cal compliment Horace gives Cani-
dia the best thrust.— nautis . .
et institoribus : the lowest classes 3
cf. n. to 3, 6, 30.

21—36. With moeking extrava-
gance Horace describes his suffer-
ings.—fugit‚ reliquit, etc.: note
the animated asyndeton.—iuven-

tas et . . . color: modest youth's
fresh color. ’

22. Horace is reduced to skin
and bones. He may have derived
his description from Theoc. 2,‘·
88 ff. καί μευ Ι χρὼς μὲν ὁμοῖος
ἐγίνετο πολλάκι θάψῳ, Ι ἔρρευν δ’ ’
ἐκ κεφαλᾶς πᾶσαι τρίχες · αὐτὰ ¹
λοιπὰ Ι ὅστι’ ἔτ’ ἦς καὶ δέρμα. ‘And
ostentimes my skin waxed wan as
the color of boxwood2 and all my
hair was falling from my head, and
what was left of me was but skin
and bones ’ (Lang). Cf. also
Sil. Ital. 2, 466 ff. iam lurida sola
Ι tecta cute et venis male iuncta
trementibus ossa Ι extant, consump-
tis visu deformia membris.

23. albus t wlzitened. — odori-
bus: sweet smelling (magic) un-
guents. Cf. 5, 59.

24 f. labore: dzlrtress. —urgetz
presses close. Cf. C. 2, 18, 15 tru-
ditur dies die. Note the effective
order of the following. — neque est
levare: a Greek construction.
