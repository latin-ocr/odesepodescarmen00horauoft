HORATI

centum iuvencis, sive mendaci lyra

40 voles, sonare ‘Tu pudica, tu proba
perambulabis astra sidus aureum.'
Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vicem
fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece
adempta vati reddidere lumina:

45 et tu (potes nam) solve me dementia,
o nec paternis obsoleta sordibus,
nec in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus
novendialis dissipare pulveres!
Tibi hospitale pectus et purae manus,

39. mendaci: a telling thrust.
This word like sacris v. 6, has a
double meaning. His lyre may
be mendax in what it has already
said or in what it will proclaiin.

40 f. sonare ε sound abroad.
Cf. C. 2, 13, 26.—tu pudica, tu
proba: so Catullus in mockery
42, 24 pudica et proba, redde
codicillos. —perambulabis : for her
virtues Canidia shall be raised to
heaven and wander among the
other stars.

42—44. Helen's brothers, Cas-
tor and Pollux, punished her de-
famer Stesichorus with blindness
(cf. C. 4, 9, 8) ς his recantation is
preserved by Plato, Plzoectr. 243 A.
οὐκ ἔστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος Ι οὐδ’
ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν ἐυσέλμοις, οὐδ’ ἵκεο
Πέργαμα Τροίας.

—vicemz lot. —vatix a hard.
Cf. n. to 16, 66.

45. et tu: ‘you too have divine
power) For the coinplimentary
potes nam. cf. S. 2, 3, 283 f., ‘unum

me surpite morti! dis etenim sa-
cile est' orabat.

46-52. At the very climax of
the appeal Horace repeats the

worst slanders current against ι

Canidia. — o nec paternis, etc. :
‘unsullied by disgraceful parents‚’
implying that Canidia's parentage
was dubious. With the phrase, cf.
C. 2, 10, 6 obseleti sordes tecti, and
Cic. pro Sest. 60 (virtus) neque
alienis unquam sordibus obsolescit.

47 f. prudens anus: nor art thou
a laag skilled to scatter‚ etc. The
ashes of the poor whose relatives
could not protect their tombs were
stolen by such witches for their
magio rites. —— novendialis : i.e. just
put away. According to Apul.
Met. 9⁷ 31 the funeral rites were
not ended until the ninth day
( nono die completis apud tumulum
sollemnibus). They closed appar-
ently with a sacrifice and banquet
in honor of the dead. —pulveresz
plural, to match sepulcris.
