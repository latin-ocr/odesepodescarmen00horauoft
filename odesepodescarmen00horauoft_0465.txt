[17‚60

tuusque venter Pactumeius, et tuo
cruore rubros obstetrix pannos lavit,
utcumque fortis exsilis puerpera.
Quid obseratis auribus fundis preces?
Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis
Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo.
Inultus ut tu riseris Cotyttia

volgata, sacrum liberi Cupidinis,

et Esquilini pontifex venefici

impune ut urbem nomine impleris meo?
60 Quid proderit ditasse Paelignas anus

L 49. tibi: sc. est. — hospitale
ι peetus, etc.: some wish to see

s here a reference to Ep. 5, but per-
„ haps the sneer should be taken in

a general sense.

50-52. tuusque . . . tuo: Intr.
28 e. The charge implied in 5, 5.
—venten cf. Livy 1, 34, 3 {gno-
rans nurum ventrem ferre. —

, Pactumeius: a genuine Roman

name. -utcumque, etc: as often

. as, implying that Canidia has prac-

ticed this deceit more than once3
her recovery is so rapid and com-
plete (fortis exsilis) that all the
world knows her children are sup-
posititious.

53. Canidia's answer. The
poet skillfully makes his victim
condemn herself by her threats of
vengeance on him, her accuser.

54 f. non saxa, etc.: this line
continues the figure, and we may
translate‚—r0cks are not . . . wlzen
Neptune. Cf. C. 3, 7, 21 scopu-
lis surdior Icari. -nudisz ship-

wrecked and stripped of all they
owned.

56. inultus: emphatic, express-
ing the gist of her exclamation.
—utz with the subj. in exclama—
tion, —‘What, shall you‚' etc.—
Cotyttia: this reference to the sen-
sual orgiastic worship of the Thra-
cian Cotytto is only literary; there
is no evidence that it was prac-
ticed at Rome. ——sacrum, etc.:
added in explanation of the fore—
going. The rites are those of
unrestrained passion (liberi Cupi-
dinis).

58. Esquilini, etc.: the inter-
pretation of this is doubtful. It
probably means that Canidia in
scorn calls him pontifex, i.e. cen-
sor and judge of her magic rites,
for the part he had presumed to
play in representing her and Sa-
gana (S. 1, 8) busy with their foul
work among the burial places of the
poor on the Esquiline. The ponti-
fices had oversight over all sacra.
