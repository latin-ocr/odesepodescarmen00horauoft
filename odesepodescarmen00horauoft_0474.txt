This Work differs in many respects from the former edition. Such
changes and alterations have been introduced as are necessary to
make the book conform to modern demands, and many important addi-
tions have also been made.

The Introduction has been enlarged by the addition of sections
on the life and writings of Virgil, the plan of the Aeneid, the meter,
manuscripts, editions, and helpful books of reference.

The Text has been corrected to conform to the readings that have
become established, and the spellings are in accord with the evidence of
inscriptions of the first century A.D. To meet the need of early
assistance in reading the verse metrically, the long vowels in the first two
books are fully indicated.

The Notes have been thoroughly revised and largely added'to. The
old grammar references are corrected and new ones (to Harkness's
Complete, Lane ἃ Morgan’s, and Bennett’s Grammars) added. The
literary appreciation of the poet is increased by parallel quotations
from English literature. The irregularities of scansion in each book
are also given with sufficient explanations.

The Vocabulary has been made as simple as possible and includes
only those words occurring in the Aeneid. The parts of compound
words are not indicated separately when they appear unmodified in
the compound form. The principa] parts of verbs are given which are
understood to be in actual use.

The Illustrations for the most part are new and fresh. and have
been selected with great’ care with a view to assisting directly in the
interpretation of the text. There are als‘o maps showing the wan-
derings of Aeneas, the vicinity of Cumae, and pre-historic Rome.
and a full-page facsimile of one of the best manuscripts of Virgil, the
Codex Palatinus.
