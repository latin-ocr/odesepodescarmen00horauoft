The works of Latin Literature of the post-Augustan
period have hitherto, with a few notable exceptions, been
virtually exeluded from the classieal curricula of colleges
and universities.

The present collection has been made primarily for the
use of students in higher classes in colleges. The selec-
tions will be found useful as collateral reading in con-
nection with lectures on Classical literature, and will also
furnish suitable material for sight reading.

The selections themselves contain nothing that is not
eminently worthy of perusal. They are in every case
sufficiently extensive to give a continuous and coherent
story, which at the same time exhibits the author at his
best. The text follows the best modern editions, the
deviations from the standard texts being briefly recorded

in critical appendices.
