In this Revised Edition of Cicero’s Laelius the editor’s
aim in preparing the notes has been to furnish all explana-
tions that seem necessary for the clear understanding of
points of grammar, history, biography‚ and ancient cus-
toms occurring in the book. In addition to this, the
attention of the student has been called by translation
and remark upon special passages, to the literary char-
acter of the essay and to the clear and happy development
of the subject.

The Introduction gives an interesting historical sketch
of Cicero’ s life which cannot fail to impart a clear appre-
ciation of the man and his work. This is followed by an
analysis and summary of the Laelius which will prepare
the student for an intelligent study of the text.

Its convenient form and arrangement especially adapt
this Revised Edition for use as a text-book.
