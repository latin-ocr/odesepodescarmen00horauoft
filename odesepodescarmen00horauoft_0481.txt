This standard Grammar not only presents the latest
and best results of Greek studies, but also treats the
language in the light received from comparative philology.
Its comprehensive treatment of the principles and forms
of the Greek language, together with its clear, analytic
method, has made it at once an authoritative and exhaus-
tive treatise for reference and at the same time a practical
and popular text-book for class use. The fact that during
all these years it has held its place and maintained its wide-
spread popularity and extensive use in the leading lesical
schools and colleges of the country is in itself sufficient
evidence of the excellence of the original work.

Professor Hadley's Greek Grammar was published in
1860, and was founded on the scholarly and exhaustive
work of the eminent German professor, Curtius, of the
University of Kiel.

Professor Allen brought to the work of revision the
enthusiasm and critical method of an accomplished scholar,
combined with the ex‘perience and skill of a successful
teacher, and the result of his labors is gratifying alike to
the publishers and friends of the Grammar.

In its present form it is a practical work for beginners.
Clearness of statement, accuracy of definition, and judicious
arrangement recommend it for elementary classes; yet at

the same time it is a complete and comprehensive manual
for the advanced student.
