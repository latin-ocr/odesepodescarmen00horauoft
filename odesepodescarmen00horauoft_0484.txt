THE DrALocUEs or PLATo contained in this volume
exhibit the moral qualities of Socrates in their highest
manifestations, and also give some insight into those
intellectual processes by virtue of which he mac'z an
epoch in philosophy. In addition to the Apology and Crito
there has been included that part of the Phaedo which
describes in detail the last sayings and doings of Socr'ateS.

'l‘he Introduction gives a clear and comprehensive ¹
outline of the life, character, and philosophy of Socrates.
This historical sketch is followed by other aids to an
understanding of Plato's dramatic representation of his
great master and by a critical analysis of the argument
pursued in the Dialogues,

'l‘he Text is based upon that of Wohlrab in his revision
of the text of Hermann (6 vols., Teubner, Leipzig—Vol. I,
1886). The grammatical and exegetical notes have been
drawn principally from Cron (Teubner, Leipzig, 1895).
The appendix contains a brief account of the notable
manuscripts and editions of Plato’s works and some of
the more important variations in the text of the Apology‚
the Crito, and the Phaedo, together with the principal
authorities for each variation.
